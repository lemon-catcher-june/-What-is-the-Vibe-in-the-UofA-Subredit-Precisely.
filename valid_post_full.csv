You stood mere inches behind me in line the CAB quick serve Tim's (despite my attempts to create space between us and you moving up closer every time), complaining the entire time that you were going to be late to class despite getting in line after 11 am. You complained the whole time about how slow they were moving, and that you had somewhere to be. For 10 full minutes everyone around you listened to you complain about how ridiculous it is that the employees have kept you waiting despite the fact that you have a class to be in.

Your mistake was saying, out loud and clear to everyone, ""I really want a croissant"". There was one left. I didn't want a croissant but I knew what I had to do.

Your complaints about how terrible the service is is not nearly as funny or endearing as you seem to think. It is frustrating that service slows down around class breaks, but it was your decision and yours alone to get coffee despite the fact that you had somewhere to be. These people are working for a living and THEY are the reason you get to bring Tim's to class with you. Maybe practicing a bit of patience and time management would be of benefit to you. Was this an asshole move? Most definitely. I don't need judgement there, I know it was unecessary and petty. But as someone who has worked enough minimum wage service jobs, it's not the difficult to recognize when being petty is appropriate.

Attention!!A Chinese student was attacked in University Station.,683,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/myji8a/attentiona_chinese_student_was_attacked_in/,128,"We need more attention in this case, and give this guy some help!!!!

**I am not the victim, please go to the original post and share it. Let the government and media know. We need people's attention in this case, it is horrible!!!!**

RE:  Last night at 9:25pm, I was attacked by a crazy stranger with a knife on the Univeristy Station platform. While I took the train from Corona station to Univeristy station, the stranger he came to sit down next to another guy and me. He thought he had asked me some questions. In fact, he never asked me anything. He then followed me when I got off at the Univeristy Station. Next to the train door, he assaulted me and punched my face. I defended myself, he then stabbed my arm with a knife. The LRT driver stopped the train when other passengers were aware of the offence happned on the Univeristy station platform. However, passengers did not offer me any help to contact police and ambulance. Even though the guy had already escaped from university station escalator, a group of train passengers stopped others who were inclined to get off train from helping me, saying “it is his problem”. After the LRT train and other passengers left, I pressed the emergency button on the Univeristy station platform to wait for help. The Univeristy of Alberta Protective Service (UAPC) office is located in education building, which is 15 minutes walk from the train station, but I waited about 15-20 minutes to have the city police arrived instead of those UAPC. Shame for humanity, public security of the City of Edmonton and the Univeristy of Alberta campuses.

I have been studying at the Univeristy of Alberta since Spetmber 2015, and I will graduate from my Bachelor of Commerce Cooperative Education Program this summer. As an international student, I have a stong sense of belonging with University of Alberta and regard City of Edmonton as my second home. I feel so disappointed to experience this horrible incident and realized how fragile the humanity could be facing challenges. I do not deserve what happened, the horrible thing should not happen to other people in the communities of University of Alberta, and City of Edmonton! It is more disappointing that I might not never know the charge on that person who attacked me with his knife and was caught by city police, unless the case is dealt by public prosecutors. I chose not to tell this incident to my parents as I do not make them worry about me in China. I decided to let the public know for the awareness that how dangerous it can suddenly be when you had trust for your communities. More ironically, I am interning at the TransEd LRT partners to support the public-private partners in the operation and maintenance functions of Valley Line Southeast project in the City of Edmonton.

PSA: not everyone who is for CR/NCR is a piece of shit who didn't work hard,582,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/flnvmq/psa_not_everyone_who_is_for_crncr_is_a_piece_of/,58,"Okay ualberta reddit hear me out...

I get that you're angry and upset and scared. Me too. It's been a long semester and we've been working our asses off towards goals that many of us have dreamt about since we were children 

BUT that doesn't mean that we get to be cruel and quick with our judgement. We have literally no idea what some people are going through because of this right now. 

For a second let's just put aside the very lucky students who live in Edmonton with their families and get to ride this out from the comfort of their bedroom with their family all safe and sound with them. 

I want you to consider the students who have came from far away, both domestic and international, who in the last week have had their entire lives uprooted. In the middle of this many have faced immense pressure to return home to their families. If you live at home I want you to think about this for a second: in the next five days you have to completely pack up your entire life, tie up all of your loose ends, find a place to live for when you return (maybe summer, maybe September, who knows at this point), oh and by the way classes are still happening so good luck catching up. 

I want you to consider the people who are under intense financial stress, because that majorly affects things. I know people who have lost coop jobs or other summer work placements they were depending on to pay for school. I know people who's parents have been laid off and are being asked to contribute financially. I know these are things that can be dealt with, but it is just more added stress in the middle of an already stressful experience (which definitely negatively affects academic performance) 

I want you to think of students who have kids, who are now scrambling to care for a child on top of going to school. I know people are saying you can work from home and take care of your kid and I don't know how much you know about toddlers, but I can tell you that a three year olds tantrum does not give a fuck that you're trying to write an online exam. 

I know that it's hard to accept that some people who haven't really worked that hard are going to slip through this semester, but don't you dare tell me that all of the people who will benefit from this didn't work hard. This virus has affected mass amounts of students in unimaginably stressful ways, and, if no measures are taken, will negatively impact academic achievement for people who aren't lucky enough to have the ideal situation. This isn't even taking into account the students who will get sick or have loved ones get sick. 

I'm not saying it's the best option, I'm just saying that telling people they are a piece of shit who just wants to cheat on their finals is kinda not cool. 

Let's try and keep loving each other my dudes, even though the world is a lil scary rn. 

(Sorry what I'm sure is an abundance of bad grammar, but quite frankly I don't give a fuck)",2020-03-19 21:27,0.201,0.726,0.072,-0.5113,PSA: not everyone who is for CR/NCR is a piece of shit who didn't work hard

Earlier tonight, UAPS called me to say that they found my backpack, including my laptop and (more importantly) my thesis data. It looks like the thief realized there wasn't very many valuables in there and ditched the bag. Maybe they were just looking for some quick drugs. The only things missing were some CBD oil, about $5 in loose change, 1 of my 2 calculators, a USB that thankfully didn't have anything important on it, and a few packs of gum. I got off lucky. But, I got even luckier that someone found were the bag was dumped and was kind enough to bring it to the lost-and-found in GSB.

I learned some very valuable lessons from this situation. Even though my locker was in a secured area with keycards, it should have been locked up anyways from the start. For those that do any lab work in Katz, there are no cameras which can leave your stuff vulnerable, so just play it safe. Also, keep everything even mildly important on the cloud and try to keep hardcopies of that work in a separate area in the event of a technological malfunction, fire, burglary, etc..

I didn't ask for this to happen to me, but you can't always expect people to not act like assholes. Thank you to everyone who showed your support on my last post. I really appreciate it and it made the shitty situation a little more tolerable. Finally, thank you to whoever turned the backpack in to the lost-and-found.

&#x200B;

So I cheated.

&#x200B;

I walked past my friends at NYF, smiling at them as I usually do. They were a bit confused when they saw me walk past them - I normally get a poutine at this time. I walked out of their sight and to the people at Subway. I bought a BLT. My plan was to quickly buy the sandwich and head to the LRT. But as I turned around after grabbing the sandwich, my eyes locked with the lady from NYF!!!! SHE WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO ME. She shook her head in disbelief and walked past me. After that, I felt sick to my stomach because of the guilt ^(and the food).

Winter Pro-Tips for YEG Newbies,431,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/doc7qz/winter_protips_for_yeg_newbies/,109,"Maybe this should be in r/Edmonton but I met a group of Indian foreign students yesterday who literally had NO FUCKING IDEA how to deal with Alberta weather so I figured this could also work. (Not to scare anyone, but just catch people up on handy winter logic that will mostly apply to the -25 C range.) I know some of this seems pretty common sense but if it helps one person, then that would be great. (Also when my parents moved here in the 80s no one helped them out so here's to trying to change that. Hi, hello. This is mom for two seconds.) Please add your tips in the comments!

**DRIVING**

* Congrats, you have a car! If you're parking outside, plug that ish in if you plan on leaving it there for more than an hour in -15 C weather. Save money on gas and reduce the risk of it just not starting.
* If you're with AMA, make use of Roadside Assistance. Not everyone is but figure out who to call in emergencies from your registry.
* Get winter tires.
* Check your oil frequently.
* Make sure your washer fluid is full.
* Lift your windshield wipers from your window so they don't freeze onto the car if you're parking outside.
* Leave fucking early.
* Leave enough room between you and the person in front of you.
* Those colourful ""Big Ticket Event"" signs aren't advertising sales. Cops are just handing out more speeding tickets at this period.
* If you find yourself skidding, turn your wheels to face the direction you want to go into. (DON'T OVERCORRECT.)
* Avoid braking dramatically when you are going under bridges. (But don't speed up!)
* Get the snow off the roof of your car too or the driver behind you will curse you.
* Drive with your thumbs up. (I think AMA does an actual winter driving 1 hr class if you're nervous about driving!)
* Definitions:
   * **Black Ice**: Ice that looks fucking black on the road so you can't see it - assume it's there and slow down.
   * **Windrows**: The sides of the road that get piled up with snow, either from other cars or snow graders.
   * **Graders**: These bad boys remove snow from the streets. You probably won't see one.
   * **Windchill**: An added degree of cold thanks to the wind. Aka, what the temperature REALLY feels like.
   * **Calcium Chloride:** That blue stuff they sprinkle on the sidewalks to melt the ice. I'm not sure if the city is using it this year, but if not, it will be some other salt or sand. (And yes, it can dry up on your shoes, but it's pretty easy to wash off.)
* Things every Edmontonian parent will tell you to have in your car:
   * gas at least a third full
   * extra jacket/mittens
   * small shovel
   * window scraper
   * jumper cables
   * OPTIONAL: first aid kit, emergency blanket, extra tire, sand, antifreeze
* How to jump a car, in order:
   * **Red on Dead (+)**
   * **Read on Live (+)**
   * **Black on Dead (-)**
   * **Black on Live (-)**
      * Start the functional car and let it run for a few minutes, and then start the dead car and let it run for a few minutes. Accelerate the dead car a couple times while in park.
      * Remove the cables in REVERSE.
      * Plug that ish in when you get back to an outlet.
* If your car is stuck, DON'T GUN IT.
   * Try reversing first.
   * Take a couple pieces of cardboard (like a flattened pizza box) and jam each right in front of your front wheels to get some traction and make a ramp.
   * If that fails, this is why you have the shovel.

**SNOW/ICE**

* If you have to walk on a long stretch of unsanded ice, shuffle/slide. Or walk while lifting your entire foot at once (hard to explain, sorry). There's a bit of a crouch involved?
* If you find yourself falling, DON'T CATCH YOURSELF WITH YOUR HANDS. If you can't save yourself with your legs, accept defeat and lean into the fall with your side. Save your wrists.
* At risk of sounding creepy, watch how kids play outside at recess and deal with the tumbles. It's not the same as experiencing it first hand but unfortunately that's something I kind of got used to at a young age that newcomers have to become accustomed to.

**GENERAL WARMTH**

* Invest in a few single-use hand/toe warmers.
* Cover your nose, fingers, toes, ears and extremities.
* LAYERS.
* **SUPER A1 PRO TIP**: Use goggle wipes to prevent your glasses from fogging up when walking around with a scarf around your nose. I just learned this and it blew my fucking mind.
* How to help someone who is fucking frozen/might have hypothermia:
   * If you can't get the person out of the cold, get them off any cold ground/surface.
   * Take off anything wet they might be wearing and dry them off.
   * HEAT UP THE TORSO FIRST. If you go straight to fingers and toes they might go into shock.
   * Monitor their breathing and pulse, and check the lips, ears and digits for purple/blue discolouration.
   * Give them warm drinks.
   * Call 911.

**MISC**

* Don't believe people when they say the dark is gloomy. Frosty mornings/evenings can be absolutely stunning and cozy.
* Edmonton students from kindergarten/preschool to university have never had a snow day. Ever. Don't expect it.
* After working out, avoid going straight outside. Protect your muscles and cool down a bit first.
* Correct me if I'm wrong, but you have a 48 hour window to shovel your driveway/sidewalk before someone can report your property to the city. Just maintain it and don't risk a slip from a mailman or something.
* Invest in bright lamps to keep you awake.
* You know the campus pedways, but there are also a bunch downtown!  [https://www.edmonton.ca/documents/PDF/DowntownPedwayMap.pdf](https://www.edmonton.ca/documents/PDF/DowntownPedwayMap.pdf)
* In the next few weeks, Roots, Cabelas, Eddie Bauer, Mountain Equipment Co-op and Campers' Village will have a ton of good quality  jackets and mitts on sale. These can be a worthwhile investment if you don't want to drop your rent on a goose jacket. You can get really affordable, warm and grippy boots at The Shoe Company. If you can only afford one pair, go for a mid-calf length. (Anything right at your ankle is a waste - just my opinion.) Looking cute won't matter in a couple months.
* If your boots aren't waterproof (not the same as water-resistant), get a waterproof spray. Kunitz sells some cheap ones that work really great.
* When you enter a building or car, knock the snow off your boots. It's good etiquette and will stop everyone from slipping on water in the halls.
* Sunglasses and sunscreen! Those UV rays can still damage your eyes and skin, especially with the extra glare from the white snow/ice.
* For goodness' sake, help people when they're stuck, fallen, or struggling to move. This isn't just for newbies; one day you'll need it too.
* Embrace the snow if you can. Build a snowman or use it to freeze boiling maple syrup. If you can't beat it, become one with it.
* You can't toboggan down ski hills. I know.

Good luck. Winter isn't all doom and gloom here but to enjoy it, you gotta be safe and not be an asshole to others. You'll figure it out.

Feeling unsafe on campus due to increasing amounts of homelessness,407,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/10x6a29/feeling_unsafe_on_campus_due_to_increasing/,154,"Coming to school has been really scary lately. The LRT is scary enough, but for the uneasy feeling to continue as we walk to our classes through campus is not right. Just today, as the escalators were down, we had to all walk up the stairwell as a man smoked meth. The other day there was a woman cleaning her meth pipe in HUB. There hasn't been a single day in the past 3 weeks that I've walked up from the LRT to HUB without seeing numerous people tucked away sleeping in the corners. I've seen some really scary people in the pedways, and walking throughout campus. The bathrooms have been getting trashed. There were multiple homeless people who had to be removed from SUB as they were trying to sleep on the bean bag chairs. 
I can no longer leave my computer and run to the washroom, I have to pack everything up and take it with me just to be sure it doesn't get stolen. I end up getting so anxious thinking of coming to class and what I might see next, or if this will be the day that I get robbed or attacked. 
No change is happening. 

So this is what I'd like to know. This falls back on the city more than the university, although both can share some blame. What can we do as students to increase our safety on campus?
I've been thinking of writing a letter to the news station and raising awareness of what student life has been like on campus. Maybe that might raise city awareness.

If you have an experience that you think might be worth including in the letter I write, please share your story below. I think it's time we voice our concerns and time for the city to help those who are clearly struggling and need somewhere to go for help or warmth.",2023-02-08 11:07,0.0,0.857,0.143,0.128,Feeling unsafe on campus due to increasing amounts of homelessness

Just putting it out there,387,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/p4oqby/just_putting_it_out_there/,30,"My dad had passed away to Covid. He was just 50. I just turned 18. Nice way to remind me of adulthood. 

He wasn't vaccinated. For some reason we decided to wait it out. Heck, it seemed like we could. And then all of a sudden, a few days in the ICU and he was gone. I don't know. I didn't even get to tell him how much I loved him. Didn't get to tell him goodbye. It was a pretty fuck all nightmare entering that ICU. My dad's soulless body just lying on the bed, nothing on the heart monitor. Just dead. It seems like no one would really care unless it actually affects them directly but, I'm just putting this out there. Don't make the same mistake my family did.

Some might say, well wait a bit. Please don't. I lost my own dad due to my family's negligence. Unrelated, my mom might have just tested for a tumor as well. World's falling apart for me. It's pretty hard dealing with finances like an adult now, because my dad used to do everything for me. Not anymore. It didn't hit me until I had to look realistically, financially. Nothing else like having  to look over your own dads cremation.

Please don't let this happen to you. I know you might be afraid of lack of testing but, what else can convince you that you just can't take the risk. I'm lucky enough my dad set up my finances in a way I can at least pay for my education. But I know people who couldn't even dream of that if their dad passed away. Just, wear masks or at least take care of yourself and your family.

And just get the dose. It doesn't even hurt. I cried after I got my 2nd. I just thought, what if my dad had gotten the vaccine? Would he have still been alive? It's your choice, but I don't want any of you to experience the same shit I'm dealing with right now. You really don't have to.",2021-08-15 00:56,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Just putting it out there

A Brief History of the Ghoul War,382,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/alncmy/a_brief_history_of_the_ghoul_war/,20,"*I write this in lecture hall E1001 in ETLC. I have been here for days now, attempting to document the Ghoul War (2019) from its inception to the brutal conflict it has become, but I fear my time is running out, and my meticulous documentation is to end with it. Food is scarce, but I dare not venture out to seek it. My comrades have fallen or fled, and I am now but one man, left alone to face the evil that wanders these halls, an evil that grows bolder with each passing minute. It is only time that keeps them at bay, not a defence so much as the last dignity providence bestows upon me, a flimsy last rite to prepare me for a terrible fate. I beg of you, let my sacrifice be not in vain. Heed my words, for they will be all that remain of my foolish quest, a quest that has brought me to the end of my documentation, the end of my ambitions, and now the end of my life.*

On January 24, a post by u/lividnaynay (henceforth called “Livid”) caused something of an uproar on r/ualberta. The post, simply titled “[Take a Damn Shower](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/ajdz4l/take_a_damn_shower/)” described rather vividly Livid's unpleasant olfactory encounter with another student. Livid's account is curiously accurate, despite limited understanding of the threat at the time. He described a 10-foot kill radius (experimentally confirmed) and nausea after 15 minutes raw exposure (the literature puts this value around 13.6 minutes). But at the end of the post, he wrote a simple, harmless little question, a question that would change campus as we know it:

“Can u guess my faculty?”

Within three minutes, u/sagotaromilktea responded “engineering lmaoo”.

The floodgates were open. Once people began to realize they weren't the only ones repulsed by the odors engineering students gave off, the long dormant seeds of their discontent suddenly sprouted. They were not alone in their disgust, and they revelled in the fleeting solidarity that the post evoked as it made the rounds on r/ualberta. But discontent isn't enough to start a war, especially one so monumental as this. And as all posts do, it eventually slipped away from the top, leaving only the lingering aftertaste of the rage it took with it. I think now it would be better if it stayed that way, if the war amounted only to an awareness of our feelings. If it remained contained within our minds, instead of splattered unceremoniously on the snow of quad, the stairs of ETLC, and the hearts and hands of all those who have have died at the hands of the enemy, and all those who will. It would be better for me, yes. But I digress.

The word “ghoul” didn't enter the vernacular until three days later, when u/RogerMooreIsMyDad, son of Roger Moore, made a post on r/ualberta called “[Why do the ghouls smell so bad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/akjsg8/why_do_the_ghouls_smell_so_bad/)” The body of the post read: “I swear im going to buy a costco pack of deodorant and hand it out to all the little engg ghouls running around DICE”.

Throughout history, combatants will give their enemies derogatory names. Dehumanization is an important tool in war, as perceiving one's enemy as lacking human qualities erases much of the sympathy one would otherwise have for them. The less human something is, the easier it is to kill.

The people were stirring. They finally had a word to express their hatred, a rallying cry, and most importantly, an understanding that their feelings didn't have to be confined to a single post. The stage was finally set for war.

u/SweatyEnggGhoul (suspicious username notwithstanding) came forward several hours later with [an account](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/akoetv/a_moment_of_silence_for_the_girls_in_engg/) condemning the ghouls for being not only biohazards, but also fedora-tippers. He described how he acted quickly, scaring the ghouls off with Febreze upon their attempt to cannibalise a hapless virgin. This first conflict, considered by many of my dead colleagues, and as a tribute to their memory, by me as well to be the first battle of the Ghoul War caused an uproar on the subreddit, garnering over one hundred upboats in less than a day. While the war had yet to take shape into the terrible conflict it is today, it had finally begun.

Three hours later, u/pengus-and-icecubes called the subreddit to war with perhaps one of the most beautiful speeches in military history. I have included it here, as it seems an injustice not to:

“Things are getting out of hand, we need to combat the ghouls. Bring febreze and deodorant wherever you go and don't hesitate to shoot! My nose can't handle this anymore. Teach these scum about hygiene, they're more unsafe than walking through HUB at 9pm.”

Initially, the war effort was disorganized. u/Gflsfcm8516 made a post several hours after Pengu's magnificent call to arms called “When will the war on the ghouls begin?”. But in less than a day, a ragtag assembly of troops seemed to coalesce into a strong fighting force, a feat likely owed to their commitment to the cause. Livid suffered a great loss at the hands of the new military upon his insistence not to resort to violence, and has since assumed a figurehead role, closely monitored at all times. [Propaganda art](https://i.redd.it/ylfhjzql58d21.jpg) from u/SUBRE extolling the strength and resolve of great leader Pengu was released to general acclaim.

The ghouls remained blissfully unaware of the chaos outside their faction until Jan 28, when u/Captain_Donadeo, captain of a ghoul exploratory mission, discovered SUB, a major base for the war effort. His final post revealed that he was under attack, presumably by our forces in SUB. It can only be assumed that Captain Donadeo was able to transmit a message to his superiors in ETLC, as approximately two hours later, u/Ghoul_0xFFFFFFFF, a ghoul ambassador, made a post called “ALERT FELLOW STUDENTS: The war on “Ghouls” violates university policy!”. In it, he claimed that the war violated university policy, as DICE (one of the ghoul bases) is an “odor-free zone”; as such, the administration of Febreze is disallowed. However, he went on to say that ghouls were all for war, “cuz I know we'll win with our superior \[sic\] intellect”. He brazenly threatened a Tory invasion, and concluded his statement with a reiteration of his disgustingly smug reminder of University policy.

Despite the ghoul's obviously evil intent, the army found itself unable to reconcile a DICE invasion with the laws of the institution they fought within, until u/welliguessthatslife recommended that a siege be undertaken. Febreze would be sprayed on the doors until the ghouls exhausted their supplies and were forced to surrender.

ETLC, the ghoul nest, remained a warzone. Ghouls and the alliance alike suffered heavy losses. Febreze cans, fedoras, and half-eaten corpses littered the hallways. Soldiers who were lucky to make it out alive with most of their limbs would speak of the horrors they saw, as they charged up the stairs of ETLC only to see the ghouls waiting for them at the top of the stairs, grinning through bloodied teeth, their sweat waterfalling down towards the brave soldiers who ran headlong into the cold arms of death.

And yet the battle spread. CCIS, a neutral zone, became the home of the bloodiest battles the war had scene. Ghouls furiously blasting sweat-soaked tissues at hapless neutrals while alliance soldiers struggled to balance war, sanity, and hygiene with steadily approaching midterms.

u/isthatmoi, a self-proclaimed neutral, took to the subreddit, begging for peace. His calls were condemned as traitorous, and the war raged on.

u/Known_Grape asked what a “goddammit ghoul” is. I guess that's UNKNOWN, STUPID GRAPE.

The science kids rallied in support of the alliance, with u/TheNoChillG inventing a genius explosive ghoul repellent, an invention which ended up landing him the role of Chief Technology Officer in the Ghoul War.

*There is a pounding at the door. The ghouls, how they moan with their vile, unclean lust for blood. How they sully our campus with their stench. My time is short. I must hurry.*

TheNoChillG was to be instrumental in the progress of the war. He invented a long-range ghoul repellent using his knowledge of biology and psychology, immediately employed in the DICE siege. But the losses were piling up, and leadership grew less and less dedicated. Pengu refused to take a formal leadership role in the battle, opting instead to spread more anti-ghoul propaganda and speak of plans that would ultimately lead to victory, a la Dutch.

With hope at an all-time low, the alliance tried an all-or-nothing attack. A joint siege of ETLC and DICE, attacking ETLC from the air and taking DICE with ground troops. Despite heavy casualties and waning morale, the battle was a major success for its [liberation of DICE](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/alenob/nonghoul_engineers_celebrating_the_liberation_of/).

The ghouls attempted to strike back, capturing a major leader (whose name they forgot to mention so idk if this is even relevant). Rumours came down the wire of an attack on biosci. For a few hours, it seemed as if the war was over.

Then, out of nowhere, CAB, arguably the most strategic base on all of campus [was taken](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/aliq7x/the_ghoul_army_has_moved_and_infiltrated_cab_in_a/?ref=readnext), along with Tory and humanities. Fighting broke out in the upper levels of CAB as [unsuspecting students were preyed upon](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/aljoch/had_a_scary_encounter_in_cab_today_luckily_i/) by ghoul grunts. Ghouls began employing clever disguises, often of [business student](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/alle0l/ghoul_spy_disguised_as_business_student_circa/)s. Calls were made for the Avatar to end the war. The math majors, in a semi-surprising move, joined the ghouls. The premeds supposedly joined the alliance, but none of them actually did because they were too busy with extracurriculars.

And the comp scis moved silently in the night like lasagna, waiting for their moment to strike. Against who remains unclear.

*In any case, the war rages on with no end in sight. I have seen so many innocents fall in battle, the cause marking them for slaughter on the battlefield, and yet their eyes retaining the fury of their fellows even in death. I feel sorrow at their loss, more so now that I face my own death. My sympathy for them has finally overwhelmed my devotion to that which I fight for, but it is not a sympathy I feel for myself. I feel only shame. Shame that my hatred has guided me to the doors of death, not the compassion, the joy, the love I felt in my youth. I shall die enraged, and I shall die ashamed of it.*

&#x200B;

*I urge you now, my friends, to reconcile your endeavour with the suffering that will come from it. I urge you, my friends, to live.*

&#x200B;

*The doors are opening. My final judgement at the hand of the enemy now begins.*

*Goodbye my friends. I die so that you may live. And remember:*

&#x200B;

*He who smelleth it, dealeth it*

We as students need to push to follow the University of Toronto's OPTIONAL CR/NCR grades policy,360,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/fll1vq/we_as_students_need_to_push_to_follow_the/,136,"You can read about what the University of Toronto is doing [here](https://utsc.utoronto.ca/news-events/changes-drop-dates-and-crncr-options-students).

To summarize, students get to decide whether they want a letter grade or a CR/NCR (i.e. pass/fail) for EACH of their classes AFTER learning what their letter grade would be. This only gives you more freedom as a student, without any downsides to you.

- If you did well, you take the letter grade and boost your GPA.

- If you didn't do well, perhaps due to the current situation, then you take the CR, and your transcript isn't negatively affected.

- They also pushed their drop deadline all the way to April 25th, so if you think you're going to fail, you have until the last possible moment to drop the class. I'm not positive on how they are handling this, but you may be allowed to write your final first, too. So you'll have the opportunity to see how the online final is handled. If you didn't feel confident, and are afraid that you're going to fail, then you will still be allowed to drop the class.

This is the best option for ALL students and gives YOU the choice for how you want to handle this semester.

I don't see how anyone can argue against this option. 

WHY is the UofA choosing the option that penalizes high-achieving students? With what the UofA is proposing, all of your hard work will be for nothing, and any GPA-boosting classes that you took this semester were a complete waste (and you should have saved them for the future). If you were looking at this semester as a chance to work harder and improve, then it was all for naught, and you're stuck with the GPA you achieved in the last semester, so say goodbye to any scholarships, Dean's list, professional programs, etc. that you were working towards. Your 100% is now just as good as a 50%.

If anyone has suggestions on how we as students can organize and fight against this, please let us know. Can our Student's Union help us at all?

If you have experience with campus activism, are able to start a petition, etc. please let me know and I will add any info to this post.

The CR/NCR system is meant to be fair for *everyone*; if you introduce an opt out then that will create inequality, and those who choose to receive credits will have a semester looking worse compared to someone else's with grades.

Oh, what's that? You busted your ass for the past 3 months to *just receive credits* and you want a letter grade reflecting *all* of your hard work and dedication? Well guess what? Life is unfair and things will come crashing down at the most unexpected times and we all just have to learn to deal with it. With inevitable cheating and academic misconduct during online exams the uni has NO other choice. The grades you beg for wont accurately reflect your learning anyway in this situation with skewed averages AND even if you were to receive any grades for this semester, I doubt any uni would take them seriously.

May I remind you that the entire fucking planet is going through a pandemic and it's a shitty situation for EVERYONE, so rest assured, that any university you will apply to for your graduate program, will be aware of these dire circumstances.

Why are we being ignored?,348,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/rw4rax/why_are_we_being_ignored/,48,"With all of the uncertainty that has been going on with the three weeks of online classes, the school has not only failed to regularly update us, but they have completely ignored us on multiple counts:

1. This is the shortest winter break since 2016. Even with everything going on, the school maintains this short break that barely compensates us for the rapid transition to online, especially for those that have to figure out their residence situation in the event that everything fully goes online. An extra week would be an enormous boon not only to students, but to instructors that have said on previous posts on this subreddit that the extra week would be extremely helpful for them with the transition. The school is ignoring not only its students, but its faculty. I don't know a single person who is prepared physically or mentally for the beginning of online classes, as announced only two weeks ago, and the general consensus has seemed to be an extension for the winter break - there is even a petition for it that was put up last week on this subreddit, but as usual it has gone completely ignored by the school who seems to care little for its students' thoughts and concerns.
2. The school has not provided us with an extra week for the add/drop deadline. The add/drop deadline ends before the period for online classes does - how does this make any sense? By the time we are all settled in our classes, we will still have no idea if classes are going to transition to in-person or not. We need time to be able to figure out our situation - if classes are online many students will not want to be taking classes, or as many classes, and yet the school has not yet budged on the add/drop deadline. Not only that, but people need to be able to figure out living situations in the event that classes return to in-person rapidly. It is completely unfair that the school is keeping the add/drop deadline at only the regular 2 weeks under these circumstances.
3. Lack of transparency. The school has not given any word since the announcement prior to Christmas about any plans for the rest of the year. They have said absolutely nothing about plans to transition to in-person or remain online. We need to be kept in-touch with the executives of the school. The university is first and foremost a place for learning, an important priority before the idea of the school being a business. And with that, comes the necessity for communication with the tens of thousands of people at this school. It is unprofessional that the school has not said anything about possible plans when it comes to potential solutions like providing us with N-95 masks, making third vaccines mandatory, or creating hybrid class models. We have been completely left in the dark, even as the current situation seems to be getting worse and worse. I personally know more people with COVID-19 at this moment than at any prior time during this pandemic, and it's only going to get worse.

Little to say, I am very frustrated with how the school has been acting, and I think I speak for most when I say I am very uncertain what the future holds, and would appreciate more communication from the school and a consideration for the desires of its student body. We are aware of the financial issues stemming from the Alberta government, but that is no excuse for completely ignoring us.

Sincerely,

A frustrated guy.

I have a learning disability and was accused and Sanctioned for academic Dishonesty by the Faculty of Arts,346,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/qkpqrg/i_have_a_learning_disability_and_was_accused_and/,44,"TL;DR: Grammar errors lead to academic dishonesty charge with no reparations. 

In December 2017, a professor (who will call DF) wrongfully accused me of academic dishonesty on a paper I
submitted in a course. DF's only basis for this accusation was grammatical errors in my paper. He claimed that the grammatical errors demonstrated that the author was a student with an Asian first language and I could not have been the author and bought it from a paper mill. During the meeting with DF, I immediately responded with my diagnosis with dyslexia.

The following January, I met with the associate dean of the Faculty of Arts (who I will call RN). During the meeting with RN, they asked my to perform the patronizing and down right insulting task of reading my paper, which seemed to be a validity test of my disability. She had no interest in viewing my evidence that I had brought, such as the metadata of the paper. 

The next February, RN declared I committed academic dishonesty and imposed sanctions. I immediately appealed. Over the next months, I met with a counsel (a lawyer who was a husband of a professor) to help me navigate the appeal process and finally in May I was unanimously granted my appeal and sanctions were removed.

After the accusations, I was overwhelmed by the sanctions and their implications for my future, particularly because I was wanting to pursue a Master's degree. As a result of this stress, I had to resign from my job, leading to a lost income and reliance on my savings. It has absolutely ruined my confidence. All this lead to a severe depression, which because of my financial situation, I couldn't address. 

Throughout the process I endured a disrespectful and undignified learning experience and now that I am pursuing an after-degree, the accusation of academic dishonesty has had a clear impact on my ability to submit assignment, exams, ect. out of fear of the same discrimination. 

The real kicker is that after I had won the appeal, no one from the university reached out to make sure I was ok. No resources were put in place to help me. Not even an apology or acknowledgement of the stress I was placed under. 

In order to have some form of closure, I recently submitted a discrimination complaint which has been denied (due to time limit). 

Hopefully this wasn't too long and somewhat understandable. I think everyone should be concerned about what the UofA views as there responsibility and how serious it views academic dishonesty (not enough to help the students after).

* In 1983-84, Dr. Schaeffer started lecturing at the university, teaching the same computing science course (in terms of content) as he taught today.

* Between 1989 and 2007, he lead a team of researchers in creating Chinook, an artificial intelligence program that plays checkers. In 1994, the program became the first artificial intelligence to win the world championship title in a competition against humans, when then champion Marion Tinsley conceded due to health concerns.

* Dr. Schaeffer, unsatisfied, spent 13 years attempting to solve checkers. In 2007, he proved that checkers always results in a draw if neither player makes a mistake. This proof remains the largest computational problem optimally-solved to date, and the current online version of Chinook cannot be beaten by any player.

* In 2002, he was named a Canadian Research Chair for Artificial Intelligence.

* In 2007, he was named a distinguished university professor by the University of Alberta, and elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

* From 2012 to 2018, Dr. Schaeffer was the Dean of Science at the U of A.

* After retiring, he'll be continuing to work at the company he founded, Onlea.

As a student in his final lecture and admirer of his work, I wanted to give some recognition of his contribution to computing science.

In the spirit of participation, are there any other professors currently lecturing at the U of A who have impressive accomplishments that you feel might deserve more recognition?",2023-12-08 13:47,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"Today, Dr. Jonathan Schaeffer gave his last lecture at the U of A before retirement."

I made a website that quickly generates beartracks schedules,331,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/nmj7n2/i_made_a_website_that_quickly_generates/,32,"This app takes an academic term and a list of any number of courses to generate a bunch of schedules tuned to your preferences.

[https://schedubuddy.com/](https://schedubuddy.com/)

I haven't done full testing of this so there may be bugs, although it works for the large majority of courses. If there is interest in this then I'll continue refining it and add more features such as blocking out specified times of the week, etc.

EDIT: to address some comments and discuss current limitations:

1. If a course doesn't appear in the dropdown, it's likely that it has no times associated with it. If this isn't the case, please let me know the term and course name.
2. I have (hopefully) fixed the bug with picking a starting time by turning it into a dropdown
3. Half-blocks such as intro chem labs are shown as full blocks -- I've looked into this and don't see a way to fix it unfortunately.
4. Additional features are likely to be added closer to the next time that more people will be creating schedules.
5. I will keep the website up for at least a year and then as long as it gets a few visitors per month.",2021-05-27 16:19,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,I made a website that quickly generates beartracks schedules

Dear First Year,329,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/kmyc5u/dear_first_year/,29,"**I don't know who needs to hear this or if anyone will read this but I'm in my 4th year now and want to tell you a few things.**

First of all, I'm so proud of you for finishing your first semester. It's so hard being a first-year in general, but ***you had to do your first-year during a global pandemic.***

If you got those A's I'm proud of you. If you failed a couple of courses (or all), I'm still proud of you because you got through it. Some of you may be used to being that kid that always got honors with distinction in high school but suddenly find yourself struggling to pass. You're not going crazy or getting dumber, you've been thrown into a new environment where your highschool habits won't cut it. I'm saying this because this happened to me.

I had a 95% average in grade 12, scooped up scholarships and early admissions, and then got punched in the gut really hard by uni. In my first year, I suffered from anxiety, undiagnosed depression, imposter syndrome, and shitty study habits. My GPA was 1.8 at the end of my first year and I felt like I lost myself. I still pretended I was still the same person from high school, went to parties/ hung out with friends so those around me wouldn't be able to tell that I was broken inside.

It was also a really confusing time for me because I saw people who pulled 70's in high school get A's. That's when I began to realize- I'm not entitled to good grades because I've been the ""smart"" or ""good"" kid.

In my 2nd year, I continued to suffer but improved a bit. I was taken off academic probation and went from a 1.8 to a 2.8 GPA. That summer I lost my friend to suicide. I was a train wreck, I FINALLY decided to get professional help. Therapy saved me.

In my 3rd year, the first semester went pretty well. By the second semester, I had finally learned what study habits worked for me and worked my ass off. I also started asking for help from the TA's and the professor. I asked all the questions I thought were ""dumb"" but first-year me would've never had the guts to ask. Unfortunately due to the pandemic, those grades are just written as CR/NCR on my transcript but, I know if they weren't I would have been so proud of the improvement in my results.

I took spring and summer courses to try and raise my GPA and get more credits. I lost my aunt to COVID-19 during this time. It was hard but because I had gone to therapy, I applied strategies I'd learned for how to process, feel, and cope with my pain. I managed to finish with a 3.5 overall GPA for spring/summer 2020 (full course loads for both)

In the first semester of my 4th year (Fall 2020), my mental health did take a toll due to anxiety and isolation but I managed to finish so far with a 3.9. I also got my first A+ of my degree. 

I wanted to tell you my story because when I failed my first course or got that probation email I felt so alone. I had no one to tell out of shame and embarrassment - definitely not my parents. Coming from an immigrant family- my entire self-worth up until and during my first year was based on my grades.  I thought my entire degree was a write off. But I'm telling you right now **asking for help is the best thing you can do for yourself.** Whether it's asking your TA's about concepts you don't understand, seeking therapy or getting in touch with the ombudsmen to navigate accusations- *just do it.*

Things won't get easier, but you're going to get stronger. Don't join clubs or committees for your resume or scholarships, you're going to burn yourself out. Do shit you actually care about, because then you're not going to turn into some idk premed zombie, you're going to preserve the authentic human you are.

And yeah even with my 2.8 GPA i was still getting generous scholarships from the U of A because sure my grades sucked but we're more than our grades. I found a job. I found research positions with professors who chose to look past the stain on my transcript and give me a chance.

Lean on people you love whether it's family or friends. It's okay to not take a full course load. It's okay to not finish your degree in 4 years. The average time to complete an undergrad degree is 5 and 1/2 years. You're going to make it through. You're going to redo your failed courses and be okay. You are loved. You are enough. You are stronger than you know.

I got the last croissant.,930,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/10dllm3/i_got_the_last_croissant/,61,"You know who I am. You stood mere inches behind me in line the CAB quick serve Tim's (despite my attempts to create space between us and you moving up closer every time), complaining the entire time that you were going to be late to class despite getting in line after 11 am. You complained the whole time about how slow they were moving, and that you had somewhere to be. For 10 full minutes everyone around you listened to you complain about how ridiculous it is that the employees have kept you waiting despite the fact that you have a class to be in.

Your mistake was saying, out loud and clear to everyone, ""I really want a croissant"". There was one left. I didn't want a croissant but I knew what I had to do.

Your complaints about how terrible the service is is not nearly as funny or endearing as you seem to think. It is frustrating that service slows down around class breaks, but it was your decision and yours alone to get coffee despite the fact that you had somewhere to be. These people are working for a living and THEY are the reason you get to bring Tim's to class with you. Maybe practicing a bit of patience and time management would be of benefit to you. Was this an asshole move? Most definitely. I don't need judgement there, I know it was unecessary and petty. But as someone who has worked enough minimum wage service jobs, it's not the difficult to recognize when being petty is appropriate.

And by the way? The croissant was delicious.",2023-01-16 10:42

Attention!!A Chinese student was attacked in University Station.,683,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/myji8a/attentiona_chinese_student_was_attacked_in/,128,"We need more attention in this case, and give this guy some help!!!!

**I am not the victim, please go to the original post and share it. Let the government and media know. We need people's attention in this case, it is horrible!!!!**

RE:  Last night at 9:25pm, I was attacked by a crazy stranger with a knife on the Univeristy Station platform. While I took the train from Corona station to Univeristy station, the stranger he came to sit down next to another guy and me. He thought he had asked me some questions. In fact, he never asked me anything. He then followed me when I got off at the Univeristy Station. Next to the train door, he assaulted me and punched my face. I defended myself, he then stabbed my arm with a knife. The LRT driver stopped the train when other passengers were aware of the offence happned on the Univeristy station platform. However, passengers did not offer me any help to contact police and ambulance. Even though the guy had already escaped from university station escalator, a group of train passengers stopped others who were inclined to get off train from helping me, saying ‚Äúit is his problem‚Äù. After the LRT train and other passengers left, I pressed the emergency button on the Univeristy station platform to wait for help. The Univeristy of Alberta Protective Service (UAPC) office is located in education building, which is 15 minutes walk from the train station, but I waited about 15-20 minutes to have the city police arrived instead of those UAPC. Shame for humanity, public security of the City of Edmonton and the Univeristy of Alberta campuses.

I have been studying at the Univeristy of Alberta since Spetmber 2015, and I will graduate from my Bachelor of Commerce Cooperative Education Program this summer. As an international student, I have a stong sense of belonging with University of Alberta and regard City of Edmonton as my second home. I feel so disappointed to experience this horrible incident and realized how fragile the humanity could be facing challenges. I do not deserve what happened, the horrible thing should not happen to other people in the communities of University of Alberta, and City of Edmonton! It is more disappointing that I might not never know the charge on that person who attacked me with his knife and was caught by city police, unless the case is dealt by public prosecutors. I chose not to tell this incident to my parents as I do not make them worry about me in China. I decided to let the public know for the awareness that how dangerous it can suddenly be when you had trust for your communities. More ironically, I am interning at the TransEd LRT partners to support the public-private partners in the operation and maintenance functions of Valley Line Southeast project in the City of Edmonton.

PSA: not everyone who is for CR/NCR is a piece of shit who didn't work hard,582,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/flnvmq/psa_not_everyone_who_is_for_crncr_is_a_piece_of/,58,"Okay ualberta reddit hear me out...

I get that you're angry and upset and scared. Me too. It's been a long semester and we've been working our asses off towards goals that many of us have dreamt about since we were children 

BUT that doesn't mean that we get to be cruel and quick with our judgement. We have literally no idea what some people are going through because of this right now. 

For a second let's just put aside the very lucky students who live in Edmonton with their families and get to ride this out from the comfort of their bedroom with their family all safe and sound with them. 

I want you to consider the students who have came from far away, both domestic and international, who in the last week have had their entire lives uprooted. In the middle of this many have faced immense pressure to return home to their families. If you live at home I want you to think about this for a second: in the next five days you have to completely pack up your entire life, tie up all of your loose ends, find a place to live for when you return (maybe summer, maybe September, who knows at this point), oh and by the way classes are still happening so good luck catching up. 

I want you to consider the people who are under intense financial stress, because that majorly affects things. I know people who have lost coop jobs or other summer work placements they were depending on to pay for school. I know people who's parents have been laid off and are being asked to contribute financially. I know these are things that can be dealt with, but it is just more added stress in the middle of an already stressful experience (which definitely negatively affects academic performance) 

I want you to think of students who have kids, who are now scrambling to care for a child on top of going to school. I know people are saying you can work from home and take care of your kid and I don't know how much you know about toddlers, but I can tell you that a three year olds tantrum does not give a fuck that you're trying to write an online exam. 

I know that it's hard to accept that some people who haven't really worked that hard are going to slip through this semester, but don't you dare tell me that all of the people who will benefit from this didn't work hard. This virus has affected mass amounts of students in unimaginably stressful ways, and, if no measures are taken, will negatively impact academic achievement for people who aren't lucky enough to have the ideal situation. This isn't even taking into account the students who will get sick or have loved ones get sick. 

I'm not saying it's the best option, I'm just saying that telling people they are a piece of shit who just wants to cheat on their finals is kinda not cool. 

Let's try and keep loving each other my dudes, even though the world is a lil scary rn.

Follow Up to Stolen Backpack,431,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/evg5no/follow_up_to_stolen_backpack/,18,"So I felt that after all of the help and well wishes on my last post, this subreddit deserved a conclusion to this shitty situation (especially since it actually turned out well).

Earlier tonight, UAPS called me to say that they found my backpack, including my laptop and (more importantly) my thesis data. It looks like the thief realized there wasn't very many valuables in there and ditched the bag. Maybe they were just looking for some quick drugs. The only things missing were some CBD oil, about $5 in loose change, 1 of my 2 calculators, a USB that thankfully didn't have anything important on it, and a few packs of gum. I got off lucky. But, I got even luckier that someone found were the bag was dumped and was kind enough to bring it to the lost-and-found in GSB.

I learned some very valuable lessons from this situation. Even though my locker was in a secured area with keycards, it should have been locked up anyways from the start. For those that do any lab work in Katz, there are no cameras which can leave your stuff vulnerable, so just play it safe. Also, keep everything even mildly important on the cloud and try to keep hardcopies of that work in a separate area in the event of a technological malfunction, fire, burglary, etc..

I didn't ask for this to happen to me, but you can't always expect people to not act like assholes. Thank you to everyone who showed your support on my last post. I really appreciate it and it made the shitty situation a little more tolerable. Finally, thank you to whoever turned the backpack in to the lost-and-found. You're the real MVP.",2020-01-28 19:17

I got caught cheating - what are my options?,436,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/ge9ial/i_got_caught_cheating_what_are_my_options/,23,"I'm a 4th year student finishing up my BSc.

&#x200B;

I spent my entire degree eating food from NYF. Every day, between classes, I would buy a poutine from NYF. Before my night classes, I would buy a poutine from NYF. I spent 4 years eating NYF. But honestly, I just got fed up. I couldn't bear to eat another poutine.

&#x200B;

So I cheated.

&#x200B;

I walked past my friends at NYF, smiling at them as I usually do. They were a bit confused when they saw me walk past them - I normally get a poutine at this time. I walked out of their sight and to the people at Subway. I bought a BLT. My plan was to quickly buy the sandwich and head to the LRT. But as I turned around after grabbing the sandwich, my eyes locked with the lady from NYF!!!! SHE WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO ME. She shook her head in disbelief and walked past me. After that, I felt sick to my stomach because of the guilt ^(and the food).

&#x200B;

I understand that this was very foolish of me, selfish even. I acknowledge the mistakes I made and am willing to make amends. I have never been caught cheating like this before.

Winter Pro-Tips for YEG Newbies,431,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/doc7qz/winter_protips_for_yeg_newbies/,109,"Maybe this should be in r/Edmonton but I met a group of Indian foreign students yesterday who literally had NO FUCKING IDEA how to deal with Alberta weather so I figured this could also work. (Not to scare anyone, but just catch people up on handy winter logic that will mostly apply to the -25 C range.) I know some of this seems pretty common sense but if it helps one person, then that would be great. (Also when my parents moved here in the 80s no one helped them out so here's to trying to change that. Hi, hello. This is mom for two seconds.) Please add your tips in the comments!

**DRIVING**

* Congrats, you have a car! If you're parking outside, plug that ish in if you plan on leaving it there for more than an hour in -15 C weather. Save money on gas and reduce the risk of it just not starting.
* If you're with AMA, make use of Roadside Assistance. Not everyone is but figure out who to call in emergencies from your registry.
* Get winter tires.
* Check your oil frequently.
* Make sure your washer fluid is full.
* Lift your windshield wipers from your window so they don't freeze onto the car if you're parking outside.
* Leave fucking early.
* Leave enough room between you and the person in front of you.
* Those colourful ""Big Ticket Event"" signs aren't advertising sales. Cops are just handing out more speeding tickets at this period.
* If you find yourself skidding, turn your wheels to face the direction you want to go into. (DON'T OVERCORRECT.)
* Avoid braking dramatically when you are going under bridges. (But don't speed up!)
* Get the snow off the roof of your car too or the driver behind you will curse you.
* Drive with your thumbs up. (I think AMA does an actual winter driving 1 hr class if you're nervous about driving!)
* Definitions:
   * **Black Ice**: Ice that looks fucking black on the road so you can't see it - assume it's there and slow down.
   * **Windrows**: The sides of the road that get piled up with snow, either from other cars or snow graders.
   * **Graders**: These bad boys remove snow from the streets. You probably won't see one.
   * **Windchill**: An added degree of cold thanks to the wind. Aka, what the temperature REALLY feels like.
   * **Calcium Chloride:** That blue stuff they sprinkle on the sidewalks to melt the ice. I'm not sure if the city is using it this year, but if not, it will be some other salt or sand. (And yes, it can dry up on your shoes, but it's pretty easy to wash off.)
* Things every Edmontonian parent will tell you to have in your car:
   * gas at least a third full
   * extra jacket/mittens
   * small shovel
   * window scraper
   * jumper cables
   * OPTIONAL: first aid kit, emergency blanket, extra tire, sand, antifreeze
* How to jump a car, in order:
   * **Red on Dead (+)**
   * **Read on Live (+)**
   * **Black on Dead (-)**
   * **Black on Live (-)**
      * Start the functional car and let it run for a few minutes, and then start the dead car and let it run for a few minutes. Accelerate the dead car a couple times while in park.
      * Remove the cables in REVERSE.
      * Plug that ish in when you get back to an outlet.
* If your car is stuck, DON'T GUN IT.
   * Try reversing first.
   * Take a couple pieces of cardboard (like a flattened pizza box) and jam each right in front of your front wheels to get some traction and make a ramp.
   * If that fails, this is why you have the shovel.

**SNOW/ICE**

* If you have to walk on a long stretch of unsanded ice, shuffle/slide. Or walk while lifting your entire foot at once (hard to explain, sorry). There's a bit of a crouch involved?
* If you find yourself falling, DON'T CATCH YOURSELF WITH YOUR HANDS. If you can't save yourself with your legs, accept defeat and lean into the fall with your side. Save your wrists.
* At risk of sounding creepy, watch how kids play outside at recess and deal with the tumbles. It's not the same as experiencing it first hand but unfortunately that's something I kind of got used to at a young age that newcomers have to become accustomed to.

**GENERAL WARMTH**

* Invest in a few single-use hand/toe warmers.
* Cover your nose, fingers, toes, ears and extremities.
* LAYERS.
* **SUPER A1 PRO TIP**: Use goggle wipes to prevent your glasses from fogging up when walking around with a scarf around your nose. I just learned this and it blew my fucking mind.
* How to help someone who is fucking frozen/might have hypothermia:
   * If you can't get the person out of the cold, get them off any cold ground/surface.
   * Take off anything wet they might be wearing and dry them off.
   * HEAT UP THE TORSO FIRST. If you go straight to fingers and toes they might go into shock.
   * Monitor their breathing and pulse, and check the lips, ears and digits for purple/blue discolouration.
   * Give them warm drinks.
   * Call 911.

**MISC**

* Don't believe people when they say the dark is gloomy. Frosty mornings/evenings can be absolutely stunning and cozy.
* Edmonton students from kindergarten/preschool to university have never had a snow day. Ever. Don't expect it.
* After working out, avoid going straight outside. Protect your muscles and cool down a bit first.
* Correct me if I'm wrong, but you have a 48 hour window to shovel your driveway/sidewalk before someone can report your property to the city. Just maintain it and don't risk a slip from a mailman or something.
* Invest in bright lamps to keep you awake.
* You know the campus pedways, but there are also a bunch downtown!  [https://www.edmonton.ca/documents/PDF/DowntownPedwayMap.pdf](https://www.edmonton.ca/documents/PDF/DowntownPedwayMap.pdf)
* In the next few weeks, Roots, Cabelas, Eddie Bauer, Mountain Equipment Co-op and Campers' Village will have a ton of good quality  jackets and mitts on sale. These can be a worthwhile investment if you don't want to drop your rent on a goose jacket. You can get really affordable, warm and grippy boots at The Shoe Company. If you can only afford one pair, go for a mid-calf length. (Anything right at your ankle is a waste - just my opinion.) Looking cute won't matter in a couple months.
* If your boots aren't waterproof (not the same as water-resistant), get a waterproof spray. Kunitz sells some cheap ones that work really great.
* When you enter a building or car, knock the snow off your boots. It's good etiquette and will stop everyone from slipping on water in the halls.
* Sunglasses and sunscreen! Those UV rays can still damage your eyes and skin, especially with the extra glare from the white snow/ice.
* For goodness' sake, help people when they're stuck, fallen, or struggling to move. This isn't just for newbies; one day you'll need it too.
* Embrace the snow if you can. Build a snowman or use it to freeze boiling maple syrup. If you can't beat it, become one with it.
* You can't toboggan down ski hills. I know.

Good luck. Winter isn't all doom and gloom here but to enjoy it, you gotta be safe and not be an asshole to others. You'll figure it out.

Feeling unsafe on campus due to increasing amounts of homelessness,407,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/10x6a29/feeling_unsafe_on_campus_due_to_increasing/,154,"Coming to school has been really scary lately. The LRT is scary enough, but for the uneasy feeling to continue as we walk to our classes through campus is not right. Just today, as the escalators were down, we had to all walk up the stairwell as a man smoked meth. The other day there was a woman cleaning her meth pipe in HUB. There hasn't been a single day in the past 3 weeks that I've walked up from the LRT to HUB without seeing numerous people tucked away sleeping in the corners. I've seen some really scary people in the pedways, and walking throughout campus. The bathrooms have been getting trashed. There were multiple homeless people who had to be removed from SUB as they were trying to sleep on the bean bag chairs. 
I can no longer leave my computer and run to the washroom, I have to pack everything up and take it with me just to be sure it doesn't get stolen. I end up getting so anxious thinking of coming to class and what I might see next, or if this will be the day that I get robbed or attacked. 
No change is happening. 

So this is what I'd like to know. This falls back on the city more than the university, although both can share some blame. What can we do as students to increase our safety on campus?
I've been thinking of writing a letter to the news station and raising awareness of what student life has been like on campus. Maybe that might raise city awareness.

If you have an experience that you think might be worth including in the letter I write, please share your story below. I think it's time we voice our concerns and time for the city to help those who are clearly struggling and need somewhere to go for help or warmth.",2023-02-08 11:07

Just putting it out there,387,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/p4oqby/just_putting_it_out_there/,30,"My dad had passed away to Covid. He was just 50. I just turned 18. Nice way to remind me of adulthood. 

He wasn't vaccinated. For some reason we decided to wait it out. Heck, it seemed like we could. And then all of a sudden, a few days in the ICU and he was gone. I don't know. I didn't even get to tell him how much I loved him. Didn't get to tell him goodbye. It was a pretty fuck all nightmare entering that ICU. My dad's soulless body just lying on the bed, nothing on the heart monitor. Just dead. It seems like no one would really care unless it actually affects them directly but, I'm just putting this out there. Don't make the same mistake my family did.

Some might say, well wait a bit. Please don't. I lost my own dad due to my family's negligence. Unrelated, my mom might have just tested for a tumor as well. World's falling apart for me. It's pretty hard dealing with finances like an adult now, because my dad used to do everything for me. Not anymore. It didn't hit me until I had to look realistically, financially. Nothing else like having  to look over your own dads cremation.

Please don't let this happen to you. I know you might be afraid of lack of testing but, what else can convince you that you just can't take the risk. I'm lucky enough my dad set up my finances in a way I can at least pay for my education. But I know people who couldn't even dream of that if their dad passed away. Just, wear masks or at least take care of yourself and your family.

And just get the dose. It doesn't even hurt. I cried after I got my 2nd. I just thought, what if my dad had gotten the vaccine? Would he have still been alive? It's your choice, but I don't want any of you to experience the same shit I'm dealing with right now. You really don't have to.",2021-08-15 00:56

A Brief History of the Ghoul War,382,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/alncmy/a_brief_history_of_the_ghoul_war/,20,"*I write this in lecture hall E1001 in ETLC. I have been here for days now, attempting to document the Ghoul War (2019) from its inception to the brutal conflict it has become, but I fear my time is running out, and my meticulous documentation is to end with it. Food is scarce, but I dare not venture out to seek it. My comrades have fallen or fled, and I am now but one man, left alone to face the evil that wanders these halls, an evil that grows bolder with each passing minute. It is only time that keeps them at bay, not a defence so much as the last dignity providence bestows upon me, a flimsy last rite to prepare me for a terrible fate. I beg of you, let my sacrifice be not in vain. Heed my words, for they will be all that remain of my foolish quest, a quest that has brought me to the end of my documentation, the end of my ambitions, and now the end of my life.*

On January 24, a post by u/lividnaynay (henceforth called ‚ÄúLivid‚Äù) caused something of an uproar on r/ualberta. The post, simply titled ‚Äú[Take a Damn Shower](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/ajdz4l/take_a_damn_shower/)‚Äù described rather vividly Livid's unpleasant olfactory encounter with another student. Livid's account is curiously accurate, despite limited understanding of the threat at the time. He described a 10-foot kill radius (experimentally confirmed) and nausea after 15 minutes raw exposure (the literature puts this value around 13.6 minutes). But at the end of the post, he wrote a simple, harmless little question, a question that would change campus as we know it:

‚ÄúCan u guess my faculty?‚Äù

Within three minutes, u/sagotaromilktea responded ‚Äúengineering lmaoo‚Äù.

The floodgates were open. Once people began to realize they weren't the only ones repulsed by the odors engineering students gave off, the long dormant seeds of their discontent suddenly sprouted. They were not alone in their disgust, and they revelled in the fleeting solidarity that the post evoked as it made the rounds on r/ualberta. But discontent isn't enough to start a war, especially one so monumental as this. And as all posts do, it eventually slipped away from the top, leaving only the lingering aftertaste of the rage it took with it. I think now it would be better if it stayed that way, if the war amounted only to an awareness of our feelings. If it remained contained within our minds, instead of splattered unceremoniously on the snow of quad, the stairs of ETLC, and the hearts and hands of all those who have have died at the hands of the enemy, and all those who will. It would be better for me, yes. But I digress.

The word ‚Äúghoul‚Äù didn't enter the vernacular until three days later, when u/RogerMooreIsMyDad, son of Roger Moore, made a post on r/ualberta called ‚Äú[Why do the ghouls smell so bad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/akjsg8/why_do_the_ghouls_smell_so_bad/)‚Äù The body of the post read: ‚ÄúI swear im going to buy a costco pack of deodorant and hand it out to all the little engg ghouls running around DICE‚Äù.

Throughout history, combatants will give their enemies derogatory names. Dehumanization is an important tool in war, as perceiving one's enemy as lacking human qualities erases much of the sympathy one would otherwise have for them. The less human something is, the easier it is to kill.

The people were stirring. They finally had a word to express their hatred, a rallying cry, and most importantly, an understanding that their feelings didn't have to be confined to a single post. The stage was finally set for war.

u/SweatyEnggGhoul (suspicious username notwithstanding) came forward several hours later with [an account](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/akoetv/a_moment_of_silence_for_the_girls_in_engg/) condemning the ghouls for being not only biohazards, but also fedora-tippers. He described how he acted quickly, scaring the ghouls off with Febreze upon their attempt to cannibalise a hapless virgin. This first conflict, considered by many of my dead colleagues, and as a tribute to their memory, by me as well to be the first battle of the Ghoul War caused an uproar on the subreddit, garnering over one hundred upboats in less than a day. While the war had yet to take shape into the terrible conflict it is today, it had finally begun.

Three hours later, u/pengus-and-icecubes called the subreddit to war with perhaps one of the most beautiful speeches in military history. I have included it here, as it seems an injustice not to:

‚ÄúThings are getting out of hand, we need to combat the ghouls. Bring febreze and deodorant wherever you go and don't hesitate to shoot! My nose can't handle this anymore. Teach these scum about hygiene, they're more unsafe than walking through HUB at 9pm.‚Äù

Initially, the war effort was disorganized. u/Gflsfcm8516 made a post several hours after Pengu's magnificent call to arms called ‚ÄúWhen will the war on the ghouls begin?‚Äù. But in less than a day, a ragtag assembly of troops seemed to coalesce into a strong fighting force, a feat likely owed to their commitment to the cause. Livid suffered a great loss at the hands of the new military upon his insistence not to resort to violence, and has since assumed a figurehead role, closely monitored at all times. [Propaganda art](https://i.redd.it/ylfhjzql58d21.jpg) from u/SUBRE extolling the strength and resolve of great leader Pengu was released to general acclaim.

The ghouls remained blissfully unaware of the chaos outside their faction until Jan 28, when u/Captain_Donadeo, captain of a ghoul exploratory mission, discovered SUB, a major base for the war effort. His final post revealed that he was under attack, presumably by our forces in SUB. It can only be assumed that Captain Donadeo was able to transmit a message to his superiors in ETLC, as approximately two hours later, u/Ghoul_0xFFFFFFFF, a ghoul ambassador, made a post called ‚ÄúALERT FELLOW STUDENTS: The war on ‚ÄúGhouls‚Äù violates university policy!‚Äù. In it, he claimed that the war violated university policy, as DICE (one of the ghoul bases) is an ‚Äúodor-free zone‚Äù; as such, the administration of Febreze is disallowed. However, he went on to say that ghouls were all for war, ‚Äúcuz I know we'll win with our superior \[sic\] intellect‚Äù. He brazenly threatened a Tory invasion, and concluded his statement with a reiteration of his disgustingly smug reminder of University policy.

Despite the ghoul's obviously evil intent, the army found itself unable to reconcile a DICE invasion with the laws of the institution they fought within, until u/welliguessthatslife recommended that a siege be undertaken. Febreze would be sprayed on the doors until the ghouls exhausted their supplies and were forced to surrender.

ETLC, the ghoul nest, remained a warzone. Ghouls and the alliance alike suffered heavy losses. Febreze cans, fedoras, and half-eaten corpses littered the hallways. Soldiers who were lucky to make it out alive with most of their limbs would speak of the horrors they saw, as they charged up the stairs of ETLC only to see the ghouls waiting for them at the top of the stairs, grinning through bloodied teeth, their sweat waterfalling down towards the brave soldiers who ran headlong into the cold arms of death.

And yet the battle spread. CCIS, a neutral zone, became the home of the bloodiest battles the war had scene. Ghouls furiously blasting sweat-soaked tissues at hapless neutrals while alliance soldiers struggled to balance war, sanity, and hygiene with steadily approaching midterms.

u/isthatmoi, a self-proclaimed neutral, took to the subreddit, begging for peace. His calls were condemned as traitorous, and the war raged on.

u/Known_Grape asked what a ‚Äúgoddammit ghoul‚Äù is. I guess that's UNKNOWN, STUPID GRAPE.

The science kids rallied in support of the alliance, with u/TheNoChillG inventing a genius explosive ghoul repellent, an invention which ended up landing him the role of Chief Technology Officer in the Ghoul War.

*There is a pounding at the door. The ghouls, how they moan with their vile, unclean lust for blood. How they sully our campus with their stench. My time is short. I must hurry.*

TheNoChillG was to be instrumental in the progress of the war. He invented a long-range ghoul repellent using his knowledge of biology and psychology, immediately employed in the DICE siege. But the losses were piling up, and leadership grew less and less dedicated. Pengu refused to take a formal leadership role in the battle, opting instead to spread more anti-ghoul propaganda and speak of plans that would ultimately lead to victory, a la Dutch.

With hope at an all-time low, the alliance tried an all-or-nothing attack. A joint siege of ETLC and DICE, attacking ETLC from the air and taking DICE with ground troops. Despite heavy casualties and waning morale, the battle was a major success for its [liberation of DICE](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/alenob/nonghoul_engineers_celebrating_the_liberation_of/).

The ghouls attempted to strike back, capturing a major leader (whose name they forgot to mention so idk if this is even relevant). Rumours came down the wire of an attack on biosci. For a few hours, it seemed as if the war was over.

Then, out of nowhere, CAB, arguably the most strategic base on all of campus [was taken](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/aliq7x/the_ghoul_army_has_moved_and_infiltrated_cab_in_a/?ref=readnext), along with Tory and humanities. Fighting broke out in the upper levels of CAB as [unsuspecting students were preyed upon](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/aljoch/had_a_scary_encounter_in_cab_today_luckily_i/) by ghoul grunts. Ghouls began employing clever disguises, often of [business student](https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/alle0l/ghoul_spy_disguised_as_business_student_circa/)s. Calls were made for the Avatar to end the war. The math majors, in a semi-surprising move, joined the ghouls. The premeds supposedly joined the alliance, but none of them actually did because they were too busy with extracurriculars.

And the comp scis moved silently in the night like lasagna, waiting for their moment to strike. Against who remains unclear.

*In any case, the war rages on with no end in sight. I have seen so many innocents fall in battle, the cause marking them for slaughter on the battlefield, and yet their eyes retaining the fury of their fellows even in death. I feel sorrow at their loss, more so now that I face my own death. My sympathy for them has finally overwhelmed my devotion to that which I fight for, but it is not a sympathy I feel for myself. I feel only shame. Shame that my hatred has guided me to the doors of death, not the compassion, the joy, the love I felt in my youth. I shall die enraged, and I shall die ashamed of it.*

&#x200B;

*I urge you now, my friends, to reconcile your endeavour with the suffering that will come from it. I urge you, my friends, to live.*

&#x200B;

*The doors are opening. My final judgement at the hand of the enemy now begins.*

*Goodbye my friends. I die so that you may live. And remember:*

&#x200B;

*He who smelleth it, dealeth it*

We as students need to push to follow the University of Toronto's OPTIONAL CR/NCR grades policy,360,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/fll1vq/we_as_students_need_to_push_to_follow_the/,136,"You can read about what the University of Toronto is doing [here](https://utsc.utoronto.ca/news-events/changes-drop-dates-and-crncr-options-students).

To summarize, students get to decide whether they want a letter grade or a CR/NCR (i.e. pass/fail) for EACH of their classes AFTER learning what their letter grade would be. This only gives you more freedom as a student, without any downsides to you.

- If you did well, you take the letter grade and boost your GPA.

- If you didn't do well, perhaps due to the current situation, then you take the CR, and your transcript isn't negatively affected.

- They also pushed their drop deadline all the way to April 25th, so if you think you're going to fail, you have until the last possible moment to drop the class. I'm not positive on how they are handling this, but you may be allowed to write your final first, too. So you'll have the opportunity to see how the online final is handled. If you didn't feel confident, and are afraid that you're going to fail, then you will still be allowed to drop the class.

This is the best option for ALL students and gives YOU the choice for how you want to handle this semester.

I don't see how anyone can argue against this option. 

WHY is the UofA choosing the option that penalizes high-achieving students? With what the UofA is proposing, all of your hard work will be for nothing, and any GPA-boosting classes that you took this semester were a complete waste (and you should have saved them for the future). If you were looking at this semester as a chance to work harder and improve, then it was all for naught, and you're stuck with the GPA you achieved in the last semester, so say goodbye to any scholarships, Dean's list, professional programs, etc. that you were working towards. Your 100% is now just as good as a 50%.

If anyone has suggestions on how we as students can organize and fight against this, please let us know. Can our Student's Union help us at all?

If you have experience with campus activism, are able to start a petition, etc. please let me know and I will add any info to this post.

On top of caring for their families, kids, sick loved ones they also have to deal with a shitload of administrative issues for all of us ungrateful fucks who cannot take a second to think before sending aggressive emails or complaining about newly, well thought out, implemented decisions. The CR/NCR system is meant to be fair for *everyone*; if you introduce an opt out then that will create inequality, and those who choose to receive credits will have a semester looking worse compared to someone else's with grades.

Oh, what's that? You busted your ass for the past 3 months to *just receive credits* and you want a letter grade reflecting *all* of your hard work and dedication? Well guess what? Life is unfair and things will come crashing down at the most unexpected times and we all just have to learn to deal with it. With inevitable cheating and academic misconduct during online exams the uni has NO other choice. The grades you beg for wont accurately reflect your learning anyway in this situation with skewed averages AND even if you were to receive any grades for this semester, I doubt any uni would take them seriously.

May I remind you that the entire fucking planet is going through a pandemic and it's a shitty situation for EVERYONE, so rest assured, that any university you will apply to for your graduate program, will be aware of these dire circumstances.

Why are we being ignored?,348,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/rw4rax/why_are_we_being_ignored/,48,"With all of the uncertainty that has been going on with the three weeks of online classes, the school has not only failed to regularly update us, but they have completely ignored us on multiple counts:

1. This is the shortest winter break since 2016. Even with everything going on, the school maintains this short break that barely compensates us for the rapid transition to online, especially for those that have to figure out their residence situation in the event that everything fully goes online. An extra week would be an enormous boon not only to students, but to instructors that have said on previous posts on this subreddit that the extra week would be extremely helpful for them with the transition. The school is ignoring not only its students, but its faculty. I don't know a single person who is prepared physically or mentally for the beginning of online classes, as announced only two weeks ago, and the general consensus has seemed to be an extension for the winter break - there is even a petition for it that was put up last week on this subreddit, but as usual it has gone completely ignored by the school who seems to care little for its students' thoughts and concerns.
2. The school has not provided us with an extra week for the add/drop deadline. The add/drop deadline ends before the period for online classes does - how does this make any sense? By the time we are all settled in our classes, we will still have no idea if classes are going to transition to in-person or not. We need time to be able to figure out our situation - if classes are online many students will not want to be taking classes, or as many classes, and yet the school has not yet budged on the add/drop deadline. Not only that, but people need to be able to figure out living situations in the event that classes return to in-person rapidly. It is completely unfair that the school is keeping the add/drop deadline at only the regular 2 weeks under these circumstances.
3. Lack of transparency. The school has not given any word since the announcement prior to Christmas about any plans for the rest of the year. They have said absolutely nothing about plans to transition to in-person or remain online. We need to be kept in-touch with the executives of the school. The university is first and foremost a place for learning, an important priority before the idea of the school being a business. And with that, comes the necessity for communication with the tens of thousands of people at this school. It is unprofessional that the school has not said anything about possible plans when it comes to potential solutions like providing us with N-95 masks, making third vaccines mandatory, or creating hybrid class models. We have been completely left in the dark, even as the current situation seems to be getting worse and worse. I personally know more people with COVID-19 at this moment than at any prior time during this pandemic, and it's only going to get worse.

Little to say, I am very frustrated with how the school has been acting, and I think I speak for most when I say I am very uncertain what the future holds, and would appreciate more communication from the school and a consideration for the desires of its student body. We are aware of the financial issues stemming from the Alberta government, but that is no excuse for completely ignoring us.

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

A frustrated guy.

In December 2017, a professor (who will call DF) wrongfully accused me of academic dishonesty on a paper I
submitted in a course. DF's only basis for this accusation was grammatical errors in my paper. He claimed that the grammatical errors demonstrated that the author was a student with an Asian first language and I could not have been the author and bought it from a paper mill. During the meeting with DF, I immediately responded with my diagnosis with dyslexia.

The following January, I met with the associate dean of the Faculty of Arts (who I will call RN). During the meeting with RN, they asked my to perform the patronizing and down right insulting task of reading my paper, which seemed to be a validity test of my disability. She had no interest in viewing my evidence that I had brought, such as the metadata of the paper. 

The next February, RN declared I committed academic dishonesty and imposed sanctions. I immediately appealed. Over the next months, I met with a counsel (a lawyer who was a husband of a professor) to help me navigate the appeal process and finally in May I was unanimously granted my appeal and sanctions were removed.

After the accusations, I was overwhelmed by the sanctions and their implications for my future, particularly because I was wanting to pursue a Master's degree. As a result of this stress, I had to resign from my job, leading to a lost income and reliance on my savings. It has absolutely ruined my confidence. All this lead to a severe depression, which because of my financial situation, I couldn't address. 

Throughout the process I endured a disrespectful and undignified learning experience and now that I am pursuing an after-degree, the accusation of academic dishonesty has had a clear impact on my ability to submit assignment, exams, ect. out of fear of the same discrimination. 

The real kicker is that after I had won the appeal, no one from the university reached out to make sure I was ok. No resources were put in place to help me. Not even an apology or acknowledgement of the stress I was placed under. 

In order to have some form of closure, I recently submitted a discrimination complaint which has been denied (due to time limit). 

Hopefully this wasn't too long and somewhat understandable. I think everyone should be concerned about what the UofA views as there responsibility and how serious it views academic dishonesty (not enough to help the students after).

* In 1983-84, Dr. Schaeffer started lecturing at the university, teaching the same computing science course (in terms of content) as he taught today.

* Between 1989 and 2007, he lead a team of researchers in creating Chinook, an artificial intelligence program that plays checkers. In 1994, the program became the first artificial intelligence to win the world championship title in a competition against humans, when then champion Marion Tinsley conceded due to health concerns.

* Dr. Schaeffer, unsatisfied, spent 13 years attempting to solve checkers. In 2007, he proved that checkers always results in a draw if neither player makes a mistake. This proof remains the largest computational problem optimally-solved to date, and the current online version of Chinook cannot be beaten by any player.

* In 2002, he was named a Canadian Research Chair for Artificial Intelligence.

* In 2007, he was named a distinguished university professor by the University of Alberta, and elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

* From 2012 to 2018, Dr. Schaeffer was the Dean of Science at the U of A.

* After retiring, he'll be continuing to work at the company he founded, Onlea.

As a student in his final lecture and admirer of his work, I wanted to give some recognition of his contribution to computing science.

In the spirit of participation, are there any other professors currently lecturing at the U of A who have impressive accomplishments that you feel might deserve more recognition?",2023-12-08 13:47

EDIT: to address some comments and discuss current limitations:

1. If a course doesn't appear in the dropdown, it's likely that it has no times associated with it. If this isn't the case, please let me know the term and course name.
2. I have (hopefully) fixed the bug with picking a starting time by turning it into a dropdown
3. Half-blocks such as intro chem labs are shown as full blocks -- I've looked into this and don't see a way to fix it unfortunately.

Dear First Year,329,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/kmyc5u/dear_first_year/,29,"**I don't know who needs to hear this or if anyone will read this but I'm in my 4th year now and want to tell you a few things.**

First of all, I'm so proud of you for finishing your first semester. It's so hard being a first-year in general, but ***you had to do your first-year during a global pandemic.***

If you got those A's I'm proud of you. If you failed a couple of courses (or all), I'm still proud of you because you got through it. Some of you may be used to being that kid that always got honors with distinction in high school but suddenly find yourself struggling to pass. You're not going crazy or getting dumber, you've been thrown into a new environment where your highschool habits won't cut it. I'm saying this because this happened to me.

I had a 95% average in grade 12, scooped up scholarships and early admissions, and then got punched in the gut really hard by uni. In my first year, I suffered from anxiety, undiagnosed depression, imposter syndrome, and shitty study habits. My GPA was 1.8 at the end of my first year and I felt like I lost myself. I still pretended I was still the same person from high school, went to parties/ hung out with friends so those around me wouldn't be able to tell that I was broken inside.

It was also a really confusing time for me because I saw people who pulled 70's in high school get A's. That's when I began to realize- I'm not entitled to good grades because I've been the ""smart"" or ""good"" kid.

In my 2nd year, I continued to suffer but improved a bit. I was taken off academic probation and went from a 1.8 to a 2.8 GPA. That summer I lost my friend to suicide. I was a train wreck, I FINALLY decided to get professional help. Therapy saved me.

In my 3rd year, the first semester went pretty well. By the second semester, I had finally learned what study habits worked for me and worked my ass off. I also started asking for help from the TA's and the professor. I asked all the questions I thought were ""dumb"" but first-year me would've never had the guts to ask. Unfortunately due to the pandemic, those grades are just written as CR/NCR on my transcript but, I know if they weren't I would have been so proud of the improvement in my results.

I took spring and summer courses to try and raise my GPA and get more credits. I lost my aunt to COVID-19 during this time. It was hard but because I had gone to therapy, I applied strategies I'd learned for how to process, feel, and cope with my pain. I managed to finish with a 3.5 overall GPA for spring/summer 2020 (full course loads for both)

In the first semester of my 4th year (Fall 2020), my mental health did take a toll due to anxiety and isolation but I managed to finish so far with a 3.9. I also got my first A+ of my degree. 

I wanted to tell you my story because when I failed my first course or got that probation email I felt so alone. I had no one to tell out of shame and embarrassment - definitely not my parents. Coming from an immigrant family- my entire self-worth up until and during my first year was based on my grades.  I thought my entire degree was a write off. But I'm telling you right now **asking for help is the best thing you can do for yourself.** Whether it's asking your TA's about concepts you don't understand, seeking therapy or getting in touch with the ombudsmen to navigate accusations- *just do it.*

Things won't get easier, but you're going to get stronger. Don't join clubs or committees for your resume or scholarships, you're going to burn yourself out. Do shit you actually care about, because then you're not going to turn into some idk premed zombie, you're going to preserve the authentic human you are.

And yeah even with my 2.8 GPA i was still getting generous scholarships from the U of A because sure my grades sucked but we're more than our grades. I found a job. I found research positions with professors who chose to look past the stain on my transcript and give me a chance.

Lean on people you love whether it's family or friends. It's okay to not take a full course load. It's okay to not finish your degree in 4 years. The average time to complete an undergrad degree is 5 and 1/2 years. You're going to make it through. You're going to redo your failed courses and be okay. You are loved. You are enough. You are stronger than you know.

"Open letter: Request for mandatory vaccinations and masking, air quality information (ventilation and filtration), & rapid testing to ensure a safe fall return to campus.",317,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/owpeth/open_letter_request_for_mandatory_vaccinations/,180,"Dear President Bill Flanagan, Provost Steven Dew, Board of Governors Chair Kate Chisholm,

In under one month, classes begin at the University of Alberta, with more than 40,000 students from around the world converging on our campuses. In addition, faculty and staff who have been largely off-site during the global pandemic will join them. We want nothing more than a normal campus experience, replete with the energy and excitement that makes campus learning and life an essential part of the educational experience. It is an understatement that COVID19 has upended this campus life, and we are about to take the first steps back to normalcy. While the vaccines are remarkably effective, they are only effective if two doses make it into one's arm. Without mandatory vaccinations, [campus shutdowns are inevitable](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-without-mandatory-covid-19-vaccination-on-campus-we-will-face-another/?utm_medium=Referrer:+Social+Network+/+Media&utm_campaign=Shared+Web+Article+Links).

**The Delta variant is a beast.** The Delta variant of COVID19 has suddenly changed the game, and will certainly not be the last variant of concern to do so. Delta is unlike the strains of SARS-CoV-2 we have dealt with in the past, with an [Ro equal to chicken pox (\~6)](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/delta-variant-cdc-contagious-1.6124795), meaning that it is highly transmissible, with the main route being [via aerosols and respiratory droplets](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/main-modes-transmission.html). While fully vaccinated individuals, more than 2 weeks post second inoculation, are largely protected, the rates of vaccination of the [age 20-24 demographic ](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-covid-19-data-statistics-numbers-cases-hospitalizations-1.5514947)in Alberta are significantly lower than the provincial average, which is already [the lowest in the country](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-vaccination-rates-1.6119338). Today, fewer than half of people of this age in Alberta are fully vaccinated, with about 30% totally unvaccinated with zero shots. While we do hope that our students will have higher vaccination rates than the general population, this critical but unknown data point makes it impossible to ensure that the Delta variant does not rip through the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated segment of these tens of thousands of students, and the staff and faculty who support them, who will be walking through and sitting in very crowded settings. Combined with unknowns regarding ventilation and filtration of our classrooms and common areas, particularly in very large lecture halls, superspreader events need to be seriously considered. Aerosols of viral particles are as mobile as smoke, and without proper ventilation and HEPA/MERV 13 filtration, superspreading is likely. Our colleague, Nelson Amaral, described succinctly the ‚Äúsuper-mixing‚Äù of students on campus (link [here](https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/letters/fridays-letters-covid-measures-needed-for-university)) in a letter to the Edmonton Journal, who said ""If we tried to design a system to rapidly spread a contagious virus during a pandemic, it would be difficult to come up with a more efficient system than the massive dynamic close proximity of university campuses.""

**Public health guidelines are insufficient for a university environment; responsibility to our stakeholders.** While the University of Alberta has stated that safety is the top priority for a smooth fall return (link [here](https://www.ualberta.ca/covid-19/about/campus-2021-22.html)), we are extremely concerned that this plan, as outlined, could fail, and that in-person teaching and other normal activities could end prematurely. The very last thing any of us would like to see is for students, faculty, and staff to fall ill and force us to pivot back online. We also do not want our community to be the cause of additional stress on our healthcare system. We have a responsibility to our stakeholders to create a safe learning environment for all students.

**Long COVID, and unvaccinated children.** Another huge concern is the faculty, staff, and students who have children not-yet-eligible for vaccination, a large and highly susceptible cohort of thoroughly COVID19-naive children. Pediatric ICU's are being overwhelmed [in some US states](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/07/29/hospitals-in-southern-us-reporting-record-numbers-of-children-hospitalized-amid-delta-surge-though-deaths-still-extremely-rare/?sh=13fe6a7c5f1e); the UK has almost identical vaccination rates to us and [cases](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/30july2021#age-analysis-of-the-number-of-people-who-had-covid-19) in children are rising. While early and playing out in real-time, some data from the UK suggests that substantial numbers of children who are infected with COVID19 still suffer from one or more symptoms 120 days later, which impair their daily lives; some data suggest as high as 40% of children are thus affected ([link](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933233-600-children-are-getting-long-covid-and-being-left-with-lasting-problems/); open access Pubmed [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7927578/)). Again, this data is being collected in real time, and in the face of the Delta variant, we believe that the precautionary principle should apply. [Long COVID](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/373/6554/491) in adults as well also has to be emphasized, with perhaps 10-25% of those having suffered through COVID19 being affected for months, and perhaps years, with debilitating symptoms. We cannot risk substantial swaths of our community suffering from preventable long COVID.

**Stress due to rational concerns and unanswered questions.** Many of your faculty, staff, and students are extremely stressed. This stress results not from an irrational fear of change (which would be more suitably termed anxiety) as we open society up, but from highly rational and science-based concerns regarding the aerosol nature of COVID19, the unknowns of ventilation in our teaching and crowded common spaces, the fact that sick people no longer are required to self-isolate, that mask-wearing is merely encouraged but not mandatory, that Delta is so highly contagious, and that long COVID can be debilitating. We emphasize that these concerns are rational, and the only way these extreme worries can be alleviated is with clear direction and information.

**Our 4 Requests.** We would like to request the following as general public health guidelines are insufficient for a university campus with tens of thousands of students in these congregate and crowded settings.

**1. Mandatory vaccinations** for all faculty, staff, and students on campus.

**2. Mandatory masks** must be worn in classrooms, hallways. Ideally, masks would be N95-grade or similar (or ASTM2 surgical mask + a mask seal, such as a [Badger Seal](https://making.engr.wisc.edu/mask-fitter/)) to effectively filter sub-micron particles. Based on current data regarding the delta variant, the CDC now [recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html) mandatory masking in schools.

**3. Measure and share ventilation and filtration data/informatio**n for all common spaces, including classroom and lecture halls. ASHRAE clearly indicates that COVID is airborne and aerosolized (link [here](https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/covid-19/iea-bahnfleth-5may20.pdf)) and has made specific recommendations to reduce airborne infectious aerosol exposure (link [here](https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/covid-19/core-recommendations-for-reducing-airborne-infectious-aerosol-exposure.pdf)). We need to follow these recommendations, and share the information with the users of these spaces. From eACH (hourly air exchanges/ventilation) > 6, to HEPA and MERV 13 (flltration), we cannot ignore the concerns of occupants regarding air quality.

**4. Institute rapid testing.** Since some fraction of the population will arrive on campus unvaccinated, vaccination clinics will take time. We will be well into October for some to develop full immunity (4 week delay between inoculations, and 2 week delay post-second dose). Start a frequent rapid testing program for these individuals.

Time is running short. We hope that a rapid uptake of these ideas can make our fall semester successful. We want nothing more.

Yours truly,

The influx of posts about BLM from Canadian uni students is nothing more than virtue signalling CMV,308,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/gv55li/the_influx_of_posts_about_blm_from_canadian_uni/,51,"Let me preface this by saying, 99% of the time the term ‚Äúvirtue-signalling‚Äù is used, it's used by people trying to undermine genuine ideological arguments from people on the left. This time however, i think its use is genuinely necessary. 

During my time here i've made a ton of very diverse friends. I'm also an out of province student and made a ton of friends in my hometown. All of a sudden everyone suddenly ‚Äúcares‚Äù about black people, including people i've had racist interactions with, or who've just stood by and watched as I was experiencing racism.

Even if we ignore my anecdotes, what the fuck does Sally from UAlberta posting about BLM do for anybody? Literally nothing. 0. Not one racist will sit there and read a few tweets and suddenly think ‚Äúhuh... Sally might be onto something‚Äù. Instead they'll think ‚Äúlet me post something just like Sally. SEE. Im not racist!!!! I just dont like blacks!!!‚Äù.  My feed and my timeline are bombarded by a bunch of virtue-signalling fucks who dont positively contribute to anything, so they decide to post a few BLM links and now they feel like they've come and saved the day. Racism cured. I understand commenting on celebrity/influencer posts to pressure them into speaking out, bc they actually have a PLATFORM and for some reason people genuinely CARE about what they think. But Sally, no one gives a fuck what you post. Frankly, being black in Canada cant even be compared to being black in the states. The real problem we have here is the INSANE systemic racism against the indigenous. Why don't we focus on our society before virtue signalling and getting up in arms about whats happening across the border? 

Let me be clear. The protesting in the US is necessary, and the rioting is achieving worldwide attention which is exactly its purpose. But my points above still stand. 

TLDR; Fuck all the Sally's and Singh's pretending to care about us and posting about BLM to feel better about themselves.

Edit: My view has changed slightly as a result of some of the comments in this thread. Reposting the RIGHT type of posts could potentially have a small impact if your social media accounts are followed by people who may be racist and MIGHT actually look inwards. That being said, it is possible that this sudden influx of posts could have a net-negative impact on the issue since people are starting to feel like posting a few black squares is enough and now they've done their part when in reality there's still so much work to do.

I know a lot of kids are struggling with rising tuition and it can be hard to find money for food, so, I just wanted to let you know of some places to get free food.

I myself am sikh, and its part of the sikh religion to serve the community and sikh temples offer free food to anyone who walks in. if you can bus to a sikh temple in Edmonton, the temple offers free food to anyone in the basement. freshly cooked and hot. its ok if you're not sikh, they welcome anyone of any race or religion. you just have to cover your head with a scarf in respect for the temple, otherwise they will give you a free hot meal with no questions asked <3

the meals typically consist of roti (a type of indian flat bread), plain yogurt, some type of dessert (such as sweet rice), and a curry or vegetable dish.

i hope this helps <3

Edit: if you have any questions, feel free to reach out and ask

i also should have mentioned this but i completely forgot. I'm not sure if all gurdwaras serve food everyday but i know this one does for sure.

We made a google chrome extension called RateMyTracks that shows the RateMyProfs ratings of each professor next to their name in a class search. It adds another column next to the prof's name and shows their rating out of 5. This extension is also completely free and can be easily disabled. You can add the extension at the [chrome webstore link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ratemytracks/fejbmlpffkoiinhibcojnjldfhedomfe). 

For some professors, the name in RateMyProfs does not match their name in Beartracks. If you see a prof that has no rating but does exist in RateMyProfs or you notice anything wonky, you can let us know by filling out this short [google form](https://forms.gle/BruiD6FEbYbbg7fA6) or by clicking the ""Contact Us"" button in the extension popup. 

Please try it out and let us know what you think of it and if we should change something.

Thanks!",2021-07-21 22:04

Unpopular opinion: Undergrads should be more respectful on research floors,289,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/te3ovq/unpopular_opinion_undergrads_should_be_more/,23," I get that study places are hard to come by, yes, and that it's difficult to find a quiet place to study. I, too, feel like the University has been inadequate in their return to campus plans and the constant UWS issues the past few weeks also indicate that they were not prepared for welcoming this many people to campus all at once‚Ä¶. 

But if you are going to look for study space on research floors and outside research labs and offices (I.e. upper floors of CCIS, Chem, DICE, etc.) please be respectful of the people who work there. Please don't move tables in front of lab doors just to sit with your friends. Please don't run laptop charging cables across the hallway when we're hauling gas tanks and carts back and forth. Please don't sit on the floor and block off the only exit simply because ‚Äúthat's where the only outlet is‚Äù. And for the love of god, don't get attitude when we please ask you to move so we can continue our research. 

And please try and keep your masks on, if possible. I might be alone in this, but it seems awfully privileged and entitled to come in to someone else's workplace, where they have been working and functioning without interruption for most of the pandemic, and brag about how ‚Äúyou're not gonna get caught up here‚Äù. To go in, interrupt grad students who are working independently and minding their own business, doing their own work, and doing their own research‚Ä¶ for what? Why? It's so unnecessary. You're coming into someone else's space, acting like entitled children, and interrupting those of us who actually need to be here and want to work. 

I'm all for quietly and respectfully sitting at tables. But for the love of god please have a little respect.",2022-03-14 12:05

A reminder of zoom etiquette,288,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/kwq26u/a_reminder_of_zoom_etiquette/,22,"Here's some brief reminders of how to behave on zoom so you and your peers get the most out of your meeting times (and so I don't have to mentally scream at anyone):

- Don't annotate the profs screen. You're not funny, you're just annoying

- Also stop interrupting the prof. Just let them speak and ask questions once they're done 

- Along the ""not funny, just annoying"" lines, if we are actually going through a lecture, stop adding dumb comments to the chat. Just because a joke pops into your head, it doesn't mean you have to type it out to distract TAs from good questions. Before class, after class, that's cool, go for it. During class, please be respectful of your peers

- Check the syllabus before you ask questions in chat. Important questions get missed when the same five questions are asked by 80 different students 

- Don't post a link to your Kickstarter. Like, it's not the time or place. Also everyone is poor so chill

- The same goes for snapchat and insta. Throw the discord link in there and figure it out there

- Not for zoom but discord, and I'm not even annoyed yet by this one because it's new for a lot of people: try your best to use the correct channels for what you have to say. It just makes things easier for everyone to sort through

That is all, good luck this sem everyone :)",2021-01-13 14:12

25% rebate secured on the UPass this semester!,279,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/takxdj/25_rebate_secured_on_the_upass_this_semester/,30,"Hi everyone,

ETS and all 11 regional transit partners have agreed to provide students a 25% UPass rebate this semester because of the 2 months we spent online! This is $45 and it will be credited to your Bear Tracks account. That's a total of around two million dollars for U of A students.

Because so many of us couldn't come to classes during January and February, and the UPass is mandatory, we agreed it was fair to provide a one-time partial refund. ETS and all the regional partners pitched in, so thanks to them for helping us make this a reality.

This is the same amount of a rebate as students in Calgary received, though in Edmonton organizing a rebate was much more complicated. The Calgary UPass only serves Calgary Transit, whereas in Edmonton there are 12 transit agencies across the Edmonton region who all needed to be engaged in this. In Calgary, it is also the universities and colleges and not the student associations that negotiate the UPass agreement, whereas in Edmonton UASU led the negotiations. So all things considered, I think this is a good deal for students.

Let me know if you have any questions!

EDIT: Because someone asked, if this is your last semester the University will send you a cheque for your remaining Bear Tracks balance

Yesterday, a few minutes before my lecture started there was this group of 4 students sitting in the back of the lecture hall either not wearing masks or poorly wearing masks. The professor quietly walked up to one of them to tell him to put on his mask and turned around. As she turned around and walked off, the guy not wearing his mask put his mask on his eyes like a blindfold and flipped her off behind her back, before putting his mask on when she went to remind everyone of the mask policy. 

We can argue all day regarding the efficacies of wearing a mask along with wearing one where mostly everyone is vaccinated, but at the end of the day those are the rules you have to follow if you want to come to class on campus. The course content is offered online as well, so you don't want to follow the rules you can just stay at home and learn from there.

The assignments are absolutely overwhelming. The amount of code you have to write is insane and the deadlines are almost always unrealistic. I find myself constantly stressed out and anxious, wondering if I'm ever going to be able to finish everything on time. And when I do manage to complete an assignment, it's not like I feel any sense of accomplishment. I'm just too exhausted to care.

The worst part is the burnout. I don't think I've had a decent night's sleep since I started this major. I'm always up late, trying to debug my code or figure out some complex algorithm. And even when I do manage to get to bed at a decent time, I'm too wired to actually fall asleep. I feel like a zombie, just going through the motions of my day without any real energy or enthusiasm.

I used to love coding. I used to love working on projects and coming up with solutions to complex problems. But now, I feel like I'm just going through the motions. I don't even know if I'm passionate about this anymore. All I know is that I'm stuck in this major and I can't wait to graduate and move on to something else.

So, if you're considering majoring in computer science, I would strongly advise against it. The assignments, the code, and the burnout just aren't worth it. Trust me, you'll be much happier pursuing something else.",2023-04-05 21:26

Why I ain't signing no petition,274,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/flobgl/why_i_aint_signing_no_petition/,49,"Oh boy I'm gonna get downvoted into hell but hear me out: if you value your grades above the health of the general population, maybe we should all be re-evaluating our priorities. This isn't just a UAlberta, my friends. The world is shutting down. Italy is in lockdown, many research labs across the continent have been shut down... hell, the Pope even essentially cancelled Easter this year to prevent the possibility of spreading it. I can bet for damn sure there isn't any university, hospital, medical program,law school, etc. in the entire world that has not been affected. They will have to accommodate. In other words: THIS WILL NOT AFFECT YOUR GRADUATION AND POST-DEGREE PLANS. Contrary to the cutthroat competing you've grown accustomed to, the universe going into crisis IS a valid excuse for just having a ‚ÄúCR‚Äù on your transcript. No one is getting screwed over.

Yes, it is frustrating if you've been having an incredible semester, but you're not being punished any more than lower-scoring students are benefiting. No one wins, no one loses. And the bright side... YOU ARE NOT ALONE! You have an incredible, global network of college students all experiencing the same thing. We will get through this as best we can as a *society*. 

And then... finally.... just because a CR/NCR system would not produce a GPA means you lose all of your marks. Your profs will still see how you're doing! The university will be able to see your marks! If anyone gives you truly me when applying for a program, just ask the prof for a reference letter of academic achievement? 

I don't know. I'm definitely mostly against this, but that's just based on my perspective. It seems awfully selfish to value your own marks over the health of your colleagues, and this seems like a perfect time to practice a little humanity.",2020-03-19 21:59

Thanks for Everything UofA,270,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/oudrds/thanks_for_everything_uofa/,64,"I'm approaching my final year of school. 
 
I chose you because you claimed to have a ~99% placement in your engineering co op program, but by my first work term, I determined that was a lie. Since I got here in 2017, I'd say you place maybe 80%. Thanks. 
 
You told me you charge more tuition than other western schools because of your state of the art facilities, but when you banned us from campus because of covid, we still had to pay the high tuition. Thanks. 
 
I have gone from spending about $7.5k in my first 8 months to spending almost $11k in my final 8 months. Thanks.
 
You force so many aspiring 18 year old kids out of first year engineering by torturing us. All you care about is that sweet tuition money. I've lost so many friends and acquaintances to suicide its ridiculous. That number should be 0, but it's most certainly not. Again, thanks. 
 
You promised me a great, easy to get into, lucrative career in engineering as a way to combat the tuition and torture. If you don't go through the co op program, you're lucky to get a job at all. And if you do, you take any job you can get, most likely that pays barely enough to cover the giant loan you took out. I'm in the hole $70k and I'll be lucky to find a job when I graduate. Thanks... again. 
 
 
If you can't afford double the tuition it'll cost this year.... think long and hard about applying. 
 
If you don't like spending 60+ hours a week doing school work... think long and hard about applying. 
 
If you're not dead set on being an engineer, or if you're only doing it because you were good at math or because your parents want you to.... think long and hard about applying.

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in, as well as compare the reviews of the same course but for different professors. You can also add at resources for each course and see which courses are the easiest and most liked.

I think if enough people start using it regularly, it would help a lot of people better prepare for their future courses by looking at reviews from other students and seeing a list of resources for each course.

I plan on adding more features in the near future so stay tuned. Please feel free to leave some reviews and let me know what can be improved!

Week of Welcome cult escapist,260,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/apbmja/week_of_welcome_cult_escapist/,53,"If you know me please do not out me, my WoW colleagues may throw me to the ghouls ‚òπ 

&#x200B;

This will be long. I am sorry but I just want everyone to know what volunteering for WoW is really like. All the commercials and things they say may be true for some people but for majority WoW is just cheap labour and masking shitty work with ‚Äúyou will make great friends‚Äù. This is a list of specific examples of things they put their volunteers through which makes the entire experience no Bueno. 

&#x200B;

\*\*Acronyms:\*\*

\*\*FL\*\* ‚Äì faculty leader ‚Äì the people who get 35+ undergrads for orientation (this has been me for 2 years)

\*\*TF\*\* ‚Äì team facilitator ‚Äì the volunteers that manage the FL's

\*\*Staff\*\* ‚Äì the PAID people that manage the TF's

&#x200B;

1 ‚Äì God damn ice breakers. The day of orientation we get our students, we meet them, show them a cool video and then have almost AN HOUR AND A HALF to do ice breakers. Who really wants to play ‚Äútell me a fun fact about you‚Äù for an hour and a half? We did what's in your wallet and two truths and a lie and then like after that we were like panic, what now and we just chilled. Isn't this a waste of the new student's time? Like we should have been doing a tour? Or a presentation? Or something?

2 - One cards. This was honestly just a shit show. USUALLY WoW staff tells us to line up for one card in the middle of our campus tour. This means that each group is evenly spaced and though the line up for one card is rather long its not THAT unbearable. This year they had the genius idea of having all science students line up at the exact same time. That's like 4000+ students lining up in HUB at the same time. Kill me. And of course, literally any other time after that there was NO lineup. 

3 - Science Faculty presentation ended almost a half an hour early‚Ä¶ This I'll admit was Faculty of Sciences fault BUT the week of welcome staff didn't prepare us for this. All my students were staring at me blankly being like what do we do now? And I was like I don't know? Like play more ice breakers? I also wonder how late Faculty of Science got the schedule and maybe they didn't have enough time to prepare?

4 ‚Äì Lunch time, faculty of science did they same thing as the one card. EXCEPT THIS TIME THERE WAS NO LINE TO FOLLOW. We were just aimlessly huddling wondering where a line was. THEY DIDN'T EVEN TELL FL'S WHERE THE PIZZA WOULD BE. I didn't know which direction to go, was it outside? Was it closer to bio or front of ccis? And of course, there are like thousands of people so I can't see anything‚Ä¶

5 ‚Äì We did a tour of the campus, but it was on the last day‚Ä¶. Usually that's the things students want to see most‚Ä¶ why leave it till the last thing?

6 - Our Uni 101 presentation ended at the same time as science faculty presentation started. I guess that means we are missing the science faculty presentation‚Ä¶. Another WoW staff scheduling failure‚Ä¶

7 - The presidents address made me so uncomfortable. As we walked in there were such disgusting things happening with the golden bears athletes. Firstly, they just had resting bitch face and made it feel like we didn't belong. Secondly, they were trying to shove glow sticks down people's shirts with out their consent. I had no idea what to do. I was watching them disgust every single student they touched. It was absolutely inappropriate and disgusting. I don't understand why they thought this was okay or why you let them go in thinking this was okay. I am so appalled. Did the staff not talk to them about what was appropriate? Did the staff not tell them to fucking smile? lol

8 ‚Äì Golden rule of WoW: You are not allowed to talk about other student clubs. I am not allowed to talk about the swing club that makes me so happy every day. I am not allowed to talk about Ada's Team that offers free tutoring. I am not allowed to talk about these because I am not allowed to ‚Äúforce‚Äù my opinions on other students. You know what I can talk about though? WoW. I can force WoW on people \*\*cough cough cult cough cough\*\*

9 ‚Äì FL's are not allowed to talk to staff. Period. If you have a question it must go through a TF and then to staff. This is absolute bullshit because if you have a dire problem (ex no room, see below) staff can just easily push you off or tell the TF to deal with it. 

10 ‚Äì YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EAT THE FOOD. You are expected to volunteer all day for two days straight and any food put out is for the students NOT for the volunteers. Your shifts are 7am till at least 5pm or sometimes later (and heaven forbid you are one of the people staying up till midnight fixing all the name tags that were screwed up)

11 - We had 28 incoming undergrads and a room booked for 10. We asked our TF and they asked staff and we were told we had to stay but given no reason as to why. We were just told to suck it up. Other groups had 22 students and had rooms booked for 50 people. We asked if we could combine rooms and staff said no and gave no reason why. As volunteers we were doing our best to come up with solutions that would make you happy but nothing, we did was good enough. At least my group got a room. There were other groups that walked into their room and the tech didn't work or the room wasn't even booked. They had to run around the university looking for a free room 10 minutes before orientation? And the only thing staff kept saying was no. 

12 ‚Äì People say you make great friends during WoW but that isn't true. There is a clique and they decide whether to let you in or not. If you don't party all the time, drink all the time, be super extroverted all the time then they don't like you. You won't make friends in WoW. Also, all the TF's are just fucking each other anyways. 

13 ‚Äì You are accepted or declined to be a volunteer based solely on a TF wanting you on their team or not. I know I was hired the second time purely out of nepotism. So take that into consideration It s a corrupt organization, it's just people trying to build the best clique. 

&#x200B;

In a lot of ways, the staff set the volunteers up to fail. No matter how hard you try, you will fail. They do not give you the tools or the training needed to succeed. ESPECIALLY THE TRAINING. 

&#x200B;

Now a lot of WoW cultists will post and say, ‚Äúbut there was a 10% increase in students who signed up for orientation, that's why it was so hard to find rooms!‚Äù Yes, I get it. You got more students but that does not account for how shitty you prepared. Their scheduling was awful (something that cane be started before the summer) and THEY WAITED UNTIL THE NIGHT BEFORE TO MAKE NAME TAGS FOR 9000 PEOPLE.

&#x200B;

You are given like 6 hours of training (plus some online modules) to do two full days of orientation. You must present, give tours, answer a billion questions and expected to do this all with such little training (have the training is god awful cheering anyways)

&#x200B;

Compare all this to the ambassador program: They spend three days training you, the staff love you and always want to talk, the staff have meetings in the summer where they just look through photos of all the volunteers so that when a volunteer walks in they can immediately say your name and how nice it is to see you again (so nice), They truly appreciate their volunteers (not only do they throw party's but they make nice little thank you cards, they have awards, they bring you candy, they feed you)

&#x200B;

I originally came to WoW to volunteer, to make a difference for new students. Not to be dragged through shit because of staff's mistakes. But what do I know, maybe staff have smartened up this year? But the culture of WoW sure hasn't so good luck friends. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for listening friends. I appreciate it. 

Edit: also just like PSA, I am an extremely outgoing person. Like I love dancing in front of people, cheering, screaming and public speaking (all things you are forced to do) and I still hated wow. ",2019-02-10 19:43

You made it! 2020 was a long, confusing and difficult year but despite all of that, you are here! You made it through exams and you can finally take a breath and relax. If your grades aren't what you're used to, THATS OK, you've had to learn an essentially new way to study and prepare for every exam. You tried your best and that is something to be proud of. 

If no one else says it, I AM PROUD OF YOU. You are so strong and you've made it so far. That is no easy feat and you should cut yourself some slack. You did it. 

It's true that not everyone is in the same boat during this crazy time; some of us have yachts and jet boats, some of us have rowboats, some of us have life preservers, and some of us are drowning. But whatever you're situation has been, you've made it here. You've pushed past all the obstacles to get here and you know what? You. Did. It. 

Bad things happen and you can't do anything to change the past, so if you're still beating yourself up about not achieving something this year, don't. Don't let the past define who you are and who you want to be. Take this year and learn from it and kick even more ass next semester/year. 

You are strong and you should be proud. You've made it through a challenging year and are still standing. That is something to be proud of. 

As always, my inbox is always open if you want to chat or if you need some encouragement. Enjoy this break and try to relax. You've made it. üíï",2020-12-19 09:53

Grading system changes: Exploration Credits are now University policy!,250,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/tsgb0t/grading_system_changes_exploration_credits_are/,43,"Hey everyone,

Some of you might remember that Abner and I ran on creating a limited, optional pass-fail grading option for students in the 2021 UASU elections. After about 13 months of working through governance, that system is now here!

I'm sure we've all noticed how many posts here ask about GPA boosters and easy electives, and I've definitely found easy electives whenever I could to protect my GPA throughout my degree. This perverse incentive to not take courses outside your comfort zone or try new things is really the opposite of what University should be about, and I know it sucks for students. The goal of exploration credits is to help you take electives you actually find interesting without having to worry about your GPA. Here's how it works:

* For up to four electives in your degree, you will be able to take them as a CR/NCR course rather than for a letter grade. An exploration credit will not affect your GPA, but will count towards your degree
* You will be able to wait until the withdrawal deadline and get a sense of how hard the course is before choosing whether to take a letter grade or a CR/NCR
* Open electives all automatically qualify for exploration credits, but faculties can also choose to make list electives (like Complementary Studies and ITS in Engineering) eligible for exploration credits. Getting as many list electives as possible eligible will be a big academic advocacy project for us next year, but the response has been very positive so far
* Instructors won't know whether a student is enrolled for a letter grade or Exploration Credits
* There are some restrictions-- for example, you can only take one per term. You'll also need to be aware of any potential program impacts, because once you choose the exploration credits option, you can't reverse it
* To help students understand this better, academic advisors will be getting training over the summer on how Exploration Credits work and any potential impacts to your degree. To make sure students know how to choose exploration credits and that it's an option, there will be a bunch more communication about this in the fall, especially as we come up on the Withdrawal Deadline. Some details (like how exactly this will look on Bear Tracks) will be finalized over the summer

While many Canadian universities have some form of limited, optional CR/NCR policy for electives, I think we are now jumping to the front of the line with one of the most progressive and accessible policies in the country. This change was passed by GFC on the 21st and is now official university policy. If you're interested in all the technical details, it's [Item 10 on this GFC agenda](https://www.ualberta.ca/governance/media-library/documents/member-zone/gfc/agenda-and-docs/2022-03-21-gfc-agenda-documents.pdf). I hope this change is useful for you all and can answer any questions you have about this policy here or by email at president@su.ualberta.ca",2022-03-30 13:44

1. We get in contact with the law office burglar from the beginning of the school year. It seems as if they already know how to break into campus easily.

2. Form a human tower from L2 up. Don't want anyone to fall two levels down trying to put the hat on the dinosaur.

\-We cannot gauge attention or concern by evaluating student's faces.

\-We are unable to as easily be consulted for questions. Whether this be during lecture or after the lecture or office hours. I'm still, myself, not sure what the best way to go about doing this is yet.

\-We are not used to this style of teaching period. These tools are unique. We may be using various softwares to try and incorporate feedback, video, audio and the like. We will have technical issues. Many of us are used to writing on write boards as we go through material in order to help students follow along with us.

\-There are a few others but I will not prattle further.

***My point is that yes, in many cases you will have a lowered quality of instruction. You will likely get very confused at some points. There is a high chance of frustration at this point.***

*If you want the brutal truth: Many of us are LEARNING how to do this at the same time as you are learning the material. This will have bumps and bruises, we will make mistakes and we will sometimes stumble over ourselves. This is many of our first time ever doing this.* ***We are in an odd way, students as well as instructors now. I have NEVER done this before. I don't know how this will go.***

We're doing our best. I can attest for myself when I say I've been burning all of this time trying to rush to move course content online to try and deliver the best experience for my students. We do care.

I will be frank: I am not ready for Tuesday and I am sure I am not alone in this. I have many anxieties going forward about how this may play out. But these are just my own personal thoughts and opinions.

I hope people can understand we are trying our best. Few anticipated things to pan out this way. Many others that I speak to that are instructing are also extremely stressed out, overwhelmed and extremely worried. Please believe me when I say many of us genuinely authentically are trying to make this work.

We are at a break-neck pace with this. I can speak for myself when I say I didn't know about this plan until everyone else did. That same notification everyone else got is the one I did myself.

And giving feedback is important, we are new to this and now many of us instructors are learning how to teach and deliver in this new format effectively. Prompt constructive feedback makes a world of difference.",2020-03-15 13:31

There was a man who was being aggressive, yelling, opening and closing the windows on the train, and hitting and punching the walls and couches. He also had a backpack and a string and was whipping those at things on the train. Security was at century and told the man to calm down and asked if he was ok, and told him to ring the emergency bell if he needed anything on the train. He started really getting aggressive when the train started moving. 

He sat down next to a girl wearing a Hijab and started yelling about the devil. She was visibly scared. First another man whispered to her to take his seat, then two other girls sitting in the same area started asking if she was ok and trying to comfort her. 

All of you got off at university station and I tried to say thank you to all of you because I've been harassed on transit before but you all went off in different directions. I almost caught up with the seat guy but he was walking too fast and I couldn't keep up.

Ashamed of this institution,240,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/stp2ra/ashamed_of_this_institution/,25,"I'm in my last semester of my undergrad and this is the first time I've truly been ashamed of being a student here. 
Forcing students to go back in person for a month a half without giving us a hybrid option is cruel. I was assured by all my professors that they would record their lectures to give students the option to stay online if we did go back. However, now I'm being sent emails saying the university is not allowing them to do this. My question is why? Why force students to drop everything to come back for less than 2 months? 
I just got a good job in my area of study that I now have to give up. For what? 1.5 months of a mediocre education. In addition these are some of the things my profs have pulled on me this sem:
1. Changed midterm from open book to closed book and proctored the night before our 11am exam
2. Changed our group presentation from pre-recorded to a completely different date in person 2 days before it was due, making a bunch of stressed students scramble to find a solution that would work for all six of us
Theres more but I won't get into it :/

I'm just so drained. Trying to hold on for 2 more months but I won't even be proud to have a degree from this institution anymore. I was just starting my career and getting excited for my future and its just ironic that this cruddy university is the reason I have to give it up.

Edited to add: and I'm one of the lucky ones who lives in Edmonton. Hearing how stressed and worried my friends are about how they're going to find a place to live for 2 months, let alone afford it, is breaking my heart. Leaving their support system at home to come back to an institution thats to blame for their destroyed mental health, also losing their jobs, trying to find a place to live‚Ä¶ it's not fair to any of us man.

Why The Pass/Fail System May Be Necessary: The Pandemic's Problem,245,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/flp8en/why_the_passfail_system_may_be_necessary_the/,14,"As a preamble, I would like to say that during this semester I had worked hard to improve my GPA compared to my last semester, which was abysmal. For one of my courses, I am even expected to receive an A, which I have not gotten close to since first year. I say this merely to pre-dispose of the accusation that I am merely arguing this position so that I could continue to be lazy. The nature of this pandemic has however made the Pass/Fail system Necessary For the following reasons:

&#x200B;

1. **With Covid-19, The Question may not be** ***If*** **you get sick, it's** ***when*** **you get sick**

I apologize if this seems to be fear mongering, it may be possible we'll have a great hold on this pandemic before it gets out of hand and my point becomes mute; but as a person who lives with a health professional (Mother is a Doctor) the chances of receiving COVID-19 through second-hand contact is close to being an inevitability.

While I am confident that I will not receive any of the severe or mild side-effects of the disease due to me being young and healthy; It brings up an important point in terms of health & GPA for those that will. **Without Pass/Fail grades will not necessary be reflective of peoples work/intelligence but instead reflect health/when they got sick.** For 2 people, both of the same skill in a class, the one who gets sick due to CORVID during an important assignment/exam will be severely limited versus the person who got sick two weeks earlier or later.

While some will argue that having an Opt-in/Opt-out program will help students adapt their GPA to fit their circumstances, as GPA is a comparative score and is competitive, is it fair to let a student who through unlucky circumstances and a lacking immune system have to take a Pass/Fail be in a situation where they'll be judged compared to healthier/luckier students?For those who argue for an Opt-in/Opt-out Program, I want you to consider the following points to put into perspective what you are betting for.

1. Are you willing to bet that you won't get sick during this semester due to CORVID-19?
2. Are you willing to Bet that if you do get sick, it won't be a severe reaction/at an important time?
3. (Edited Additional Point) Are you willing to bet your prof will not get sick, and be able to accurately judge your remaining work?

With These points in mind, I hope to get it across that the nature of this pandemic makes it so that GPA may be decided more on luck, than actual skill/hard work

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Evidence Has Shown, that People are already cheating on the online systems.**

If there existed no evidence of cheating, this point would be moot as well, but with recent posts on this subreddit it is clear that cheating is a legitimate worry. It hasn't even been that long since the recent ""40 CS students cheated on their assignment"" news story broke out. Clearly the U of A needs to consider cheating as a legitimate factor in their grading scheme. **Any online exam will be hard to proctor, and inevitably (except for courses that require essay's/written assignments) be weighted towards cheaters**, and similarly as in part (1) it is not fair to have other students GPA be compared to them in a competitive market.

I do not see an easy way, on short notice, for the Uni to adapt their courses to be easily fair. What they could do, is convert all exams/tests to assignments/projects, but to expect the professors to do so on short notice isn't realistic.

With these 2 points, I hope to show that in any system that isn't Pass/Fail, the GPA of the students this year will not be representative of people who actually work/study, but instead of those who are lucky/cheating. I understand that this is a situation that does not appeal to anyone, and if anyone has a better solution I would appreciate hearing it in the comments. Until then, I believe the Pass/Fail system is necessarily the best of the set of bad solutions",2020-03-19 23:08

I've never been so burnt out in my life. This semester has been absolutely fucked. Whatever I just pulled out of my ass is worth 50% of my grade. I sacraficed a lot of things and put in so much effort all semester to maintain an A only to watch it all fall down the drain within 2 days. 4 years and I've never felt so ashamed about my academic performance. I typically don't equate my grades to my self-worth, but damn this sucks balls lol.

I've been up for 36 hours off 3 hours of sleep. I'm too exhausted to cry but too anxious to sleep now. Thanks for listening to my rant.

* A very nice cashmere scarf for my mom for Christmas this year+shipping, since I don't get to go home
* A disgusting amount of bread that I can periodically sacrifice to the large and angry seagulls that live by my house
* New toys for my friend's dog
* Purchasing Cyberpunk 2077 
* Losing horribly in online poker and then taking it out on the seagulls 
* A new pair of nice running shoes I will never go for a run in 
* Copious amounts of liquor to deal with the emotional damage inflicted on me by this institution
* Actually paying for one of my textbooks  


Why the fuck am I paying an aCaDeMiC sUpPoRT FeE when I'm on a work term, not recognized by the CRA as either a part time or full time student for that time, but still being assessed as a part time student by the university? 

I get the whole thing with paying into fees I don't directly and necessarily use myself to benefit the community, and I have no qualms about doing that during academic terms, but it does feel a bit gratuitous to fork out my hard earned cash for being a student when I'm not actually being a student. I already pay the University a hefty ""co-op tuition fee"", the rest of the fees assessed feel like a slap in the face. Yall feel me?",2020-11-17 13:24

Students will get $1250/month,236,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/g63ai1/students_will_get_1250month/,149,"Trudeau announced a new Canada Emergency Student Benefit for students not eligible for CERB. The benefit will see eligible Canadian postsecondary students receive $1,250 a month from May to August, and if you are taking care of someone else or have a disability, that amount increases to $1,750 monthly.

Low income grants for students will also be doubled for the upcoming 2020-21 school year. Instead of $3000, students get $6000. Part time students get $3600. (The low income grant is assessed when you apply for government loans and come from a low-income family. Check your ""student award letter"" for loans you have received in the past. Did you get a $3000 ""Canada Low Income Grant""? If yes, you will get it again this year, except doubled to $6000)

Students volunteering to aid the fight against COVID will also be eligible for a ""Student Service Grant"" between $1000 and $5000, depending on amount of hours served.

EDIT: Only Canadian (citizens or PR) students, in Canada or abroad, are eligible for the benefits. Minister of Employment confirms. International students 20 hr/week limit has been waived so they can work essential jobs instead.

Source: https://www.theguardian.pe.ca/news/local/new-federal-covid-19-benefit-will-give-students-1250-a-month-440900/

EDIT: You can combine the announced benefits! For example, you earn less than $1000/month + get the $1250/month + get a grant through volunteering.

EDIT: It has not been mentioned whether you can get both CERB & CESB! As of now, no confirmed details on students who are eligible for both.
